Then characters stop growing and gets boring","reviewBody":"The drama setup up to about ep 20 was great, really fun. We got to meet the characters  and learn about their faults, strengths, and challenges. THEN .... the plot froze. The characters stopped growing. And the actions shown to fill in the time were just .... without any luster or life. It just went on automatic pilot. There was small character growth in some characters, but the main love stories, taking most screen time, were absolutely BLAND LIFELESS, WITHOUT ANY FEELING OR CHEMISTRY.   Esp FL totally ruind it. She was obviously lukewarm cold to ML and honestly they should have not gotten married at the end.  The second love story between SR and BS as well.  The third love story between CS and MS is soooooo bland and suitable only for feeble seniors, ... \"just friends who happened to marry\" and Dancer and Hairdresser love story was .... well... killed by the prejudice of the audience, who was all stuck on serious people in business suits, and also lack of acting ability of the Dancer actor, who can act only scenes of his regular idol life. The Hairdresser actress is great but the script killed her character. I WATCHED THIS AS A FILLER WHILE I STRETCH, WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN, BUT IT NEVER DID and the cold FL is the trait of all KBS family dramas i have seen since 2020 except Beauty and Mr Romantic. When I think about it, all KBS family dramas since 2020 when I started watching them have cold and aloof and totally uninterested and selfishly self centered FL actress who could care less for the ML actor. All but Beauty and Mr Romantic, bc FL there has more experience and more expression, she was most complex FL of them all.  So, WHY is KBS promoting these frigid egoistical FL actresses? .  ===============================This is what I wrote after ep 24: A very very nice kdrama. The story is real, the people are real, acting is good, so you get sucked into the story.  This is a long drama with many many characters and stories so that is why it is slower and more complex than 16 episodes series. ===> You really get to see the characters struggle and growBc  it is a family drama with so many different people, ages, stories, and interactions, it is incredibly interesting. There are 5-7 love stories going on in parallel, plus exes, babies, etc.You get to see disfunctional relationships versus functional relationships :) Bad communication, no communication, and good communication... different styles... and self reflection and improvement... I like the positive vibe of this kdrama It helps that the main ML and FL are down-to-earth people with common sense and brave enough to speak their mind, take action when necessary, be gentle and respectful about it and communicate well. It is helpful that FL is not an abused /  helpless clutz / loser but a capable and warm, brave woman trying to make her late husband's dreams come true and at the same time save herself from the grief of his death and successfully run her late husband's business. She has goals and she makes it happen. Running that business was healing for her.  This is NOT an \"anio!!!!\" drama with idiotic (mis)communication, hiding, cheating, and psychotic losers.  There are villains and drama queens and questionable women, but this is not a drama with car chases, kidnapping, shootings, hot steam, etc. This kdrama is about \"normal\" people with 'normal\" range of issues, like ..  getting out from under your parent's tight hand,  dating your professor, leaving babies behind, trying to destroy competition with bad business moves, selling kids off to marriage, fighting to save a business in debt, falling in love later in life, surviving in the entertainment industry, etc. How it is solved and resolved is interesting to watch. How different people come together to make a goal happen.  How they saved their tiny brewery together. Some of the best love scenes are between the two people who lost their spouses (ML and FL), you get to see high school love at the age of 50, and it is so cute.  If you can watch ep 23 with ML and FL in the hospital, that is one of the most charming things, how an older reserved male opens his heart and turns into a high school boy but even better :) he is calmer and warmer than a young boy, and a lot more considerate and appreciative.  He is THE BEST good boy charmer out there, really. He courts her so well. He is honest, undercover, steady and very clever to always be there and be nice and ENJOY her company but never come onto her, bc she is not ready yet, she recently lost her husband, so he is catching her into his net without she even realizing.  He is very very genuine and vulnerable and naive on one hand but on the other hand, a very shrewd adult male who knows where he is going with this. He is careful to protect himself yet advancing very fast to go get her. A great hunter and scout :)  He is a very endearing character and that actor portrays him so well. I and many others wish that it was subbed faster. We have to wait a whole day for eng sub. The OST music is not really something I would remember :) After I wrote this I was humming the main song \"when will I learn life\" or whatever that is, and yeah, that is a catchy song and actually can be a very popular song. OK I give 9 on music. THe rest of the music is not really noticeable too much, It gives nice effects with actions and it is rather discrete, whcih I think is APPROPRIATE for this kdrama. So .. absence of flashy music is ok. I do think a little bit more ... well... I dontknow which word to use... zappy? emotional? stronger? passionate? alive? vibrant? music would be good. Iron Family had such catchy main song but Iron Family kdrama had more comical and drama and thriller elements so that music fit perfectly for it. This drama is more even keel so this mellow music is ok, it FITS.  This kdrama has nice \"background\" music that matches the acting, but it is nothing special. But yeah that is the feel of this drama, regular life without too much spiking.  There are younger and older people in the drama. There is only one elder and she is a dame LOL There is one baby. There are business people, \"idols\" :)  etc  There are cold hearted corporate styles and the immature dancer and everything in between. So I think many people will find someone of their age and their interest  in this kdrama and will find it interesting. I like the filming close up of their faces.  There are many comical moments. There are some tough moments, but never disgusting tough, only tough... THere are some sad moments but there is also that feel of overcoming and moving on and being nice about it. It is like ... put your slippers on, relax, and watch the story------******* After ep 25,  CHARACTERS  STAY THE SAME AND DRAMA TURNS INTO BLAH BORING . ******Chairman is chasing reluctant Gwang Sook, who politely and coldly treats him as a old geezer sugar daddy she cannot piss off, bc he helps her....  She just has that generic frozen smile on her face.... she likes to spend time alone in the brewery and to act as Mother Theresa .... but ... her romantic interest in DS is about ZERO, so he keeps dragging her around like a reluctant cow on a leash... all other couples also stay rather distant and in \"friend zone\" THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRY ANYWHERE except between minor characters FL's mom and her lover (older couple dancing tango, eating together, he feeding her, etc) except literally a few seconds between Kang Su and Bom maybe 2 times and it is just BORING!!!!!! the characters do not grow AT ALL. They are just frozen in that one moment. There are some events that happen but nothing really moves forward.  By Ep 50 we see maybe 2 minutes of Kwang Soo and Bom in flirting action, and THAT is the only truly romantic scenes, besides a few futile attempts by the Chairman (sitting on the same bench in the hospital, playing the card game in the  hospital and touching her bare arm when he wins. That was cute and flirty but she was AS COLD AS ICE).  GWANG SOOK STAYED 100% COLD. Once or maybe twice she tried kissing him but then he said to stop bc it is too much. An impotent old man, stiff and stuffy,  by script. So ... dead end relationship but they will get married like that. When ML and FL  got married, the FL actress tried to be politically correct and fake chemistry but it was only in nurse capacity, there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ROMANTIC BETWEEN THEM THE ENTIRE TIME, SHE WAS TOTALLY LUKEWARM COLD and it is not just bc of the script, it is felt as a personal barrier that was just unprofessionally not overcome Seems like the audience is all old and impotent people bc they didnt find anything wrong with the FL never calling ML to ask him how he is doing, to run to greet him, to hug him, to hold his hand, to talk to him, to invite him on dates and doing things together. I was flabbergasted. I more or less stopped watching. The drama is RUINED by a script that plays it safe to keep high ratings so characters are just ... bland blah frozen closed characters. NOTHING HAPPENS.The VERY END SCENE when they all sit around family table and FL and ML hold babies, he leans to kiss her and she just leans back and I think even with her hand tells him to go away. THIS IS FILMED. Look at ep 54 very very very last scene, at the end of their speeches. For some reason, FL was totally hostile towards the ML, her personal dislike for him was just oozing out and it was just ... UGLY to watch. Actress who acted Se Ri is awful actress and has not changed her facial expression for 50 episodes, she had 3 facial expressions - cry, look confused and in pain, or rarely smile. The most masterful actor there was Dog Tak actor, every scene with him was memorable especially the end when he was acting emotional, he is a MASTER ACTORKang Su actor came out as a decent actor. I bet he had no experience when he started and he was just a model. That is my educated guess. But he learned to act and is pretty good at it by now. ML actor is ok for this one role but he is the same all the time, in this kdrama he was THE SAME acting and character as in Five Enough. THE EXACT same. Overall, I learned how to ruin a perfectly nice drama. YOU JUST STOP CHARACTER GROWTH. THAT KILLS ANY DRAMA. many movies will try to fill the void by action scenes, violence or sex scenes, but that is trashy and without content, western media is famous for this AND THAT IS WHY WE DO NOT WATCH IT. It is contentless. meaningless. Kdramas are famous because of CREATIVE  AND MEANINGFUL CONTENT And as for KBS family dramas, I started watching them in 2020 and all were extremely trashy boring except Iron Family, which was great until the end when the mama boy stuck to his criminal mommy instead of his love,  and now For Eagle Brothers, which was fun in the first 20 episodes out of 54, but then died a premature creative death because NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED, they all just lived without changing too much, In some ways this drama is about stable and functional people and that is cool but their stable level is just ... mediocre superficial stability, nothing MAJOR changes in them.  ML and FL just ... never melted. Well FL never melted and that ruined it. Chun Soo changed in terms of ditching his old life being a slave to his wife and kid in the US. Mi Soo changed in being less shy and more assertive. Kang Su changed in terms of being less shy and more outgoing and \"normal\" civilian. Bom became less shy.  Dancer and Hairdresser changed some too, became more mature. So yeah there WERE changes and they were subtle and organic changes so it is unfair to say there was no changebut once CS and MS  got together, there was NO change, they were like a senior impotent couple or a pair of roommates, we never saw them with any FEELING for each other that was beyond friends FEMALE LEAD DID NOT CHANGE *** AT ALL ****, SHE STAYED LUKEWARM COLD  IN EVERY SINGLE SCENE UNTIL THE VERY VERY END.   and ML and FL \"romance\" took so much time so this was the dominant tone of the series That actress just botched it. Even if the script made her act coy and reserved, there was NOTHING that indicated that she likes the guy. NOTHING. He was just dragging her around like a reluctant cow on a leash.  Her level of enthusiasm for him was ZERO.  ZERO.  ZERO.  that was actually abusive to us the audience. She never even called him to wish him good night.Also, the second most important love story that took TONS of screen time, Se Ri and Boon Su, DID NOT CHANGE. THEY ALWAYS LOOKED AWKWARD AND SHE WAS A  LITTLE GIRL TALKING TO HER PROFESSOR... THERE WAS NOTHING ROMANTIC.  He hugged her a few times when she cried and that's it. There was no facial expressions, or holding hands, or anything like that. HE the actor tried to act with his eyes but she the actress was just hostile.  Her acting was pathetically inadequate.So the major love stories with the most screen time were just BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAND ***** without any feeling of enthusism whatsoever , nothing that conveyed \"I like you, I want to spend time with you, I am curious about you\"   *****  AND THAT RUINED THE DRAMA ML and Boon Su actor tried to save it but it was impossible because their female partners were UNRESPONSIVELY COLD. the overall feeling is that characters are stuck in an asleep state, not really vibrant or loving, more like ...  zombies in rote living IT IS JUST BORING","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":7}}}</script>

<p><strong>Warm, positive, functional, educational.. until ep 20. Then characters stop growing and gets boring</strong></p>  The drama setup up to about ep 20 was great, really fun. We got to meet the characters  and learn about their faults, strengths, and challenges. <br>THEN .... the plot froze. The characters stopped growing. And the actions shown to fill in the time were just .... without any luster or life. It just went on automatic pilot. There was small character growth in some characters, but the main love stories, taking most screen time, were absolutely BLAND LIFELESS, WITHOUT ANY FEELING OR CHEMISTRY.   Esp FL totally ruind it. She was obviously lukewarm cold to ML and honestly they should have not gotten married at the end.  The second love story between SR and BS as well.  The third love story between CS and MS is soooooo bland and suitable only for feeble seniors, ... "just friends who happened to marry" <br>and Dancer and Hairdresser love story was .... well... killed by the prejudice of the audience, who was all stuck on serious people in business suits, and also lack of acting ability of the Dancer actor, who can act only scenes of his regular idol life. The Hairdresser actress is great but the script killed her character. <br><br>I WATCHED THIS AS A FILLER WHILE I STRETCH, WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN, BUT IT NEVER DID <br><br>and the cold FL is the trait of all KBS family dramas i have seen since 2020 except Beauty and Mr Romantic. When I think about it, all KBS family dramas since 2020 when I started watching them have cold and aloof and totally uninterested and selfishly self centered FL actress who could care less for the ML actor. All but Beauty and Mr Romantic, bc FL there has more experience and more expression, she was most complex FL of them all.  So, WHY is KBS promoting these frigid egoistical FL actresses? .  <br>===============================<br><br>This is what I wrote after ep 24: <br>A very very nice kdrama. The story is real, the people are real, acting is good, so you get sucked into the story.  This is a long drama with many many characters and stories so that is why it is slower and more complex than 16 episodes series. <br>===&gt; You really get to see the characters struggle and grow<br><br>Bc  it is a family drama with so many different people, ages, stories, and interactions, it is incredibly interesting. There are 5-7 love stories going on in parallel, plus exes, babies, etc.<br>You get to see disfunctional relationships versus functional relationships :) Bad communication, no communication, and good communication... different styles... <br>and self reflection and improvement... <br><br>I like the positive vibe of this kdrama <br><br>It helps that the main ML and FL are down-to-earth people with common sense and brave enough to speak their mind, take action when necessary, be gentle and respectful about it and communicate well. <br><br>It is helpful that FL is not an abused /  helpless clutz / loser but a capable and warm, brave woman trying to make her late husband's dreams come true and at the same time save herself from the grief of his death and successfully run her late husband's business. She has goals and she makes it happen. Running that business was healing for her.  <br><br>This is NOT an "anio!!!!" drama with idiotic (mis)communication, hiding, cheating, and psychotic losers.  There are villains and drama queens and questionable women, but this is not a drama with car chases, kidnapping, shootings, hot steam, etc. <br><br>This kdrama is about "normal" people with 'normal" range of issues, like ..  getting out from under your parent's tight hand,  dating your professor, leaving babies behind, trying to destroy competition with bad business moves, selling kids off to marriage, fighting to save a business in debt, falling in love later in life, surviving in the entertainment industry, etc. <br><br>How it is solved and resolved is interesting to watch. How different people come together to make a goal happen.  How they saved their tiny brewery together. <br><br>Some of the best love scenes are between the two people who lost their spouses (ML and FL), you get to see high school love at the age of 50, and it is so cute.  If you can watch ep 23 with ML and FL in the hospital, that is one of the most charming things, how an older reserved male opens his heart and turns into a high school boy but even better :) he is calmer and warmer than a young boy, and a lot more considerate and appreciative.  <br>He is THE BEST good boy charmer out there, really. He courts her so well. He is honest, undercover, steady and very clever to always be there and be nice and ENJOY her company but never come onto her, bc she is not ready yet, she recently lost her husband, so he is catching her into his net without she even realizing.  He is very very genuine and vulnerable and naive on one hand but on the other hand, a very shrewd adult male who knows where he is going with this. He is careful to protect himself yet advancing very fast to go get her. A great hunter and scout :)  He is a very endearing character and that actor portrays him so well. <br><br>I and many others wish that it was subbed faster. We have to wait a whole day for eng sub. <br><br>The OST music is not really something I would remember :) After I wrote this I was humming the main song "when will I learn life" or whatever that is, and yeah, that is a catchy song and actually can be a very popular song. OK I give 9 on music. THe rest of the music is not really noticeable too much, It gives nice effects with actions and it is rather discrete, whcih I think is APPROPRIATE for this kdrama. So .. absence of flashy music is ok. I do think a little bit more ... well... I dontknow which word to use... zappy? emotional? stronger? passionate? alive? vibrant? music would be good. <br>Iron Family had such catchy main song but Iron Family kdrama had more comical and drama and thriller elements so that music fit perfectly for it. This drama is more even keel so this mellow music is ok, it FITS.  <br>This kdrama has nice "background" music that matches the acting, but it is nothing special. But yeah that is the feel of this drama, regular life without too much spiking.  <br><br>There are younger and older people in the drama. There is only one elder and she is a dame LOL There is one baby. There are business people, "idols" :)  etc  There are cold hearted corporate styles and the immature dancer and everything in between. So I think many people will find someone of their age and their interest  in this kdrama and will find it interesting. <br><br>I like the filming close up of their faces.  There are many comical moments. There are some tough moments, but never disgusting tough, only tough... THere are some sad moments but there is also that feel of overcoming and moving on and being nice about it. <br><br>It is like ... put your slippers on, relax, and watch the story<br><br>------<br>******* After ep 25,  CHARACTERS  STAY THE SAME AND DRAMA TURNS INTO BLAH BORING . ******<br>Chairman is chasing reluctant Gwang Sook, who politely and coldly treats him as a old geezer sugar daddy she cannot piss off, bc he helps her....  She just has that generic frozen smile on her face.... she likes to spend time alone in the brewery and to act as Mother Theresa .... but ... her romantic interest in DS is about ZERO, <br>so he keeps dragging her around like a reluctant cow on a leash... <br>all other couples also stay rather distant and in "friend zone" <br><br>THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CHEMISTRY ANYWHERE <br>except between minor characters FL's mom and her lover (older couple dancing tango, eating together, he feeding her, etc) <br>except literally a few seconds between Kang Su and Bom maybe 2 times <br><br>and it is just BORING!!!!!! the characters do not grow AT ALL. They are just frozen in that one moment. There are some events that happen but nothing really moves forward.  <br><br>By Ep 50 we see maybe 2 minutes of Kwang Soo and Bom in flirting action, and THAT is the only truly romantic scenes, besides a few futile attempts by the Chairman (sitting on the same bench in the hospital, playing the card game in the  hospital and touching her bare arm when he wins. That was cute and flirty but she was AS COLD AS ICE).  <br><br>GWANG SOOK STAYED 100% COLD. <br>Once or maybe twice she tried kissing him but then he said to stop bc it is too much. An impotent old man, stiff and stuffy,  by script. <br>So ... dead end relationship but they will get married like that. <br><br>When ML and FL  got married, the FL actress tried to be politically correct and fake chemistry but it was only in nurse capacity, there was ABSOLUTELY NOTHING ROMANTIC BETWEEN THEM THE ENTIRE TIME, SHE WAS TOTALLY LUKEWARM COLD and it is not just bc of the script, it is felt as a personal barrier that was just unprofessionally not overcome <br><br>Seems like the audience is all old and impotent people bc they didnt find anything wrong with the FL never calling ML to ask him how he is doing, to run to greet him, to hug him, to hold his hand, to talk to him, to invite him on dates and doing things together. <br>I was flabbergasted. <br><br>I more or less stopped watching. The drama is RUINED by a script that plays it safe to keep high ratings so characters are just ... bland blah frozen closed characters. NOTHING HAPPENS.<br><br>The VERY END SCENE when they all sit around family table and FL and ML hold babies, he leans to kiss her and she just leans back and I think even with her hand tells him to go away. THIS IS FILMED. Look at ep 54 very very very last scene, at the end of their speeches. <br><br>For some reason, FL was totally hostile towards the ML, her personal dislike for him was just oozing out and it was just ... UGLY to watch. <br><br>Actress who acted Se Ri is awful actress and has not changed her facial expression for 50 episodes, she had 3 facial expressions - cry, look confused and in pain, or rarely smile. <br><br>The most masterful actor there was Dog Tak actor, every scene with him was memorable especially the end when he was acting emotional, he is a MASTER ACTOR<br><br>Kang Su actor came out as a decent actor. I bet he had no experience when he started and he was just a model. That is my educated guess. But he learned to act and is pretty good at it by now. <br><br>ML actor is ok for this one role but he is the same all the time, in this kdrama he was THE SAME acting and character as in Five Enough. THE EXACT same. <br><br>Overall, I learned how to ruin a perfectly nice drama. <br>YOU JUST STOP CHARACTER GROWTH. THAT KILLS ANY DRAMA. <br><br>many movies will try to fill the void by action scenes, violence or sex scenes, but that is trashy and without content, western media is famous for this AND THAT IS WHY WE DO NOT WATCH IT. It is contentless. meaningless. <br><br>Kdramas are famous because of CREATIVE  AND MEANINGFUL CONTENT <br><br>And as for KBS family dramas, I started watching them in 2020 and all were extremely trashy boring except Iron Family, which was great until the end when the mama boy stuck to his criminal mommy instead of his love,  and now For Eagle Brothers, which was fun in the first 20 episodes out of 54, but then died a premature creative death because NOTHING REALLY HAPPENED, they all just lived without changing too much, <br><br>In some ways this drama is about stable and functional people and that is cool but their stable level is just ... mediocre superficial stability, nothing MAJOR changes in them.  ML and FL just ... never melted. Well FL never melted and that ruined it. <br><br>Chun Soo changed in terms of ditching his old life being a slave to his wife and kid in the US. Mi Soo changed in being less shy and more assertive. <br>Kang Su changed in terms of being less shy and more outgoing and "normal" civilian. Bom became less shy.  <br>Dancer and Hairdresser changed some too, became more mature. <br><br>So yeah there WERE changes and they were subtle and organic changes so it is unfair to say there was no change<br><br>but once CS and MS  got together, there was NO change, they were like a senior impotent couple or a pair of roommates, we never saw them with any FEELING for each other that was beyond friends<br><br> FEMALE LEAD DID NOT CHANGE *** AT ALL ****, SHE STAYED LUKEWARM COLD  IN EVERY SINGLE SCENE UNTIL THE VERY VERY END.   and ML and FL "romance" took so much time so this was the dominant tone of the series <br><br>That actress just botched it. Even if the script made her act coy and reserved, there was NOTHING that indicated that she likes the guy. NOTHING. He was just dragging her around like a reluctant cow on a leash.  Her level of enthusiasm for him was ZERO.  ZERO.  ZERO.  that was actually abusive to us the audience. She never even called him to wish him good night.<br><br>Also, the second most important love story that took TONS of screen time, Se Ri and Boon Su, DID NOT CHANGE. <br>THEY ALWAYS LOOKED AWKWARD AND SHE WAS A  LITTLE GIRL TALKING TO HER PROFESSOR... THERE WAS NOTHING ROMANTIC.  He hugged her a few times when she cried and that's it. There was no facial expressions, or holding hands, or anything like that. HE the actor tried to act with his eyes but she the actress was just hostile.  Her acting was pathetically inadequate.<br><br>So the major love stories with the most screen time were just BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAND ***** without any feeling of enthusism whatsoever , nothing that conveyed "I like you, I want to spend time with you, I am curious about you"   *****  AND THAT RUINED THE DRAMA <br>ML and Boon Su actor tried to save it but it was impossible because their female partners were UNRESPONSIVELY COLD. <br><br>the overall feeling is that characters are stuck in an asleep state, not really vibrant or loving, more like ...  zombies in rote living <br><br>IT IS JUST BORING  <p class="read-more"><a href="#" class="button">Read More</a></p>  <div class="review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t"> <div class="review-vote review-helpful-449476"><span class="text-muted">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class="btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="449476" data-label="Yes"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="449476" data-label="No"><span>No</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote" data-id="449476"><span>Cancel</span></button>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-gift-award" data-id="449476"></button>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>

I say this to introduce this drama. ML, not because he was looking for it, but it coming naturally and subtly, is just a delightful unfolding story that foremost, makes this drama so favorable to me. A widower, dedicated to visit the columbarium for his wife, with a satisfying successful life while raising his young adult children finds love. While this plot is definitely not new, the way this has panned out is such out standing planning. Scenes are created with care and variety that brings believable moments where leads just naturally develop feelings for one another. Both leads are greatly casted and they are doing such a good job portraying their characters. I’ve always complained that directors can be more creative in staying away from too much recycled tropes we see in just about every romantic dramas. Here, it is done. So far, it’s been such nice blends of humor, seriousness, heart flutter, pieces weaving together to keep those invested in this weekend gem. Yes, it’s a gem.<br><br>The leads are middle aged. Refreshing. Rarely do we see good made romantic dramas about this group range so this is such a welcomed surprise. The idol range are nice (creating lots of fantasizers) but there are so many viewers in this drama range so this is a great treat.<br><br>There are actually many couples in this story and each are just as engaging. I think that each one are given enough time and screen to develop, thus making this a wholesome family show. My bias is the main couple but then, the others just become important too as you start to feel and cheer for them too. The creations of build ups of relationships are nicely done. No nonsense misunderstandings, push and pulls. Instead, the directors presents us these characters whose story can be any of us and their management is straightforward.<br><br>Cast are so good. Veteran casts in older leads and up and coming younger ones are doing great. Veterans certainly have cemented their facial expressions to convey appropriate reactions it just amazes me. Ahn Jae Wook is eye candy and Uhm Ji Won is gorgeous and their vulnerable scenes of falling in love are so darn cute.<br><br>It might not be for everyone but it can be for anyone. Mind you this review is mid point of this ongoing show, but that’s the flow of it. Will follow with afterthoughts upon conclusion hoping upon hoping it remains good and not fall on kdrama curse of mid point fall apart.<br>🌟🌟**********************<br>Completed afterthoughts: 8/24/25 based on some themes<br>1. Love after widowed: it might not be for everyone but in the chance that it does, this surely would be a wonderful way of happening. Love and care, priority and GS n DS on top of that, laughed and smiled a lot. I liked that.<br>Remorse: Dok Tak and Miae, definitely committed wrong. Yes only because caught, as well as guilt did they come around. No one should be trodden to death by their mistakes, if they but repent and make restitution. That should be the biggest take of these two characters. Behind every bad person was once a shining pride of someone else. Our society needs to be more tolerant and of grant grace for those who truly makes the complete turnaround.<br>Child Abandonment: not all unfortunately, but more than enough there’s a story behind an ‘abandonment’. For whatever reason, there’s some worthy of sympathy. Having adopted, I sympathize greatly with the mother of my child as I understood her choice of giving up her child. If ever possible, reunion’s would be great. Se Ri being understanding and left door open for future communications about cute Ha Ni is so ideal. I’d love for my daughter to meet her birth mother someday as we left our country it’s been over thirty years.  To have that closure if anything else. It’s humanity.<br>Big Families: it is definitely not surprising as my culture is very much similar in many ways. Definitely there’s pros and cons. Keys for it to be successful is respect and mutual family closeness. The brothers were that. It helped to accommodate their different dynamics as individual couples. As long as I have a definite space to be on my own (ha, a room), big families can be very helpful.<br><br>Overall, I enjoyed this family drama. I’ve watched so many already with absolute nonstop nonsense. This, without those nuances, is uplifting, wholesome, and wonderful. It started well and ended swell. To me that is.  <p class="read-more"><a href="#" class="button">Read More</a></p>  <div class="review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t"> <div class="review-vote review-helpful-450604"><span class="text-muted">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class="btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="450604" data-label="Yes"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="450604" data-label="No"><span>No</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote" data-id="450604"><span>Cancel</span></button>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-gift-award" data-id="450604"></button>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
