This drama scored higher ratings on Douban than another show with an 8.9 rating on MDL and breached 10,000 on Youku\u2019s popularity index. Yet, if you read the reviews and comments on MDL, you will see many with an opposite sentiment. In the beginning, there were folks who judged the FL character based on her actions in the novel, and despite the scenes not even happening in the drama, began hating on her. As the show progressed, some complained that the novel had better scenes and the drama should have included them. Furthermore, fans of Zhang Ling He lamented that his ML character got less screen time than the SML and was not a strong enough character. Others wanted a full-fledged romance story and felt that the show spent too much time on palace politics and the interactions between the FL and the SML.Lucky for me, I was not influenced by such factors. Not having read the novel, I could start with a clean slate. Also, not being a major fan of any actor, I was not comparing the amount of screen time each character had. While I enjoyed the development of the leads' romance, I was most interested in seeing how the leads would triumph against the villains when given the opportunity to redo things. The show drew me in because of its interesting premise of giving multiple characters a second chance.**Why Entertaining?**Having not only one lead but multiple characters being reborn into an earlier period of their lives added a nice twist to the usual story of a second shot at life. Moreover, we got another twist where instead of the ML being the tsundere one with all the power and prestige, it was the FL, Li Rong, who started off with a colder and unapproachable personality. As the Princess Royal, she was the political heavyweight with the backing of her noble family's background. In contrast, Pei Wenxuan, the ML, came from a humble common family and was married to the FL as her Prince Consort.I liked Li Rong because she was unlike the stereotypical strong female lead. She had plenty of flaws but also had her own strengths. With conflicting personality traits, she was initially misunderstood by many viewers because she was cold and harsh on the outside towards Pei Wenxuan and yet showed care and thoughtfulness for him through her actions. Those viewers who supported and defended her against criticism finally felt vindicated when Li Rong showed character growth as she learned to trust the ML and revealed a warmer side. Through this growth, Li Rong also became freer, dropped her defensive wall, and expressed her feelings towards Pei Wenxuan more openly.What added to her appeal for me was her complicated backstory. In her first life, Li Rong was no Mary Sue; she was not your usual FL who was perfect and good, and her only fault was trusting and loving the wrong people. In Li Rong's case, she was so proud, and her pride led her to misunderstand Pei Wenxuan and cut him off. She ended up in a relationship with Su Rong Qing, the SML, for many years while her marriage to Pei Wenxuan was just a sham. This setup also led many viewers to condemn her, but for me, who cares? The story was about them getting another opportunity to change things and start afresh, so I was more interested in what happened in their present (second) lives.Zhao Jinmai did a good job as Li Rong. She was supposed to be young, and she certainly looked the part with her baby face, but she was able to portray the emotions of someone who may look young but had already experienced over 40 years of life. A life that was not easy, being entangled in palace politics. That said, there were times when I thought she was not regal enough and did not give that feeling of gravitas that someone in her position should have.As for Zhang Lihe, whether or not he got sufficient screentime, I don't think anyone can deny that he found his stride in this drama. This is his best ML role so far, and he completely embodied Pei Wenxuan as a sunny, besotted man who was also calculating. Pei Wenxuan was also prideful like Li Rong in his first life as her Prince Consort, and when given another chance, decided not to waste it by hiding his love for Li Rong like he did the first time. In the second life, he wore his heart on his sleeve, and having understood Li Rong so well, was patient and willing to bear a lot for her. To me, he was an endearing simp who had it bad for Li Rong but was not a wimp. He got things done in his own way and was a brilliant strategist with his political maneuvering. He could also outshine anyone, including Su Rong Qing, during his jealous fits. Minor spoiler alert: the scene where he played the erhu in the middle of Li Rong's and Su Rong Qing's performance was just the best.I enjoyed the progression of their relationship in the second life. Mostly through Pei Wenxuan's efforts, the leads actually talked through their issues. It took them the whole of their first lifetime to second-guess, and ultimately scheme against each other, so the second time around, they made sure to communicate. There were times when I thought there would be misunderstandings again, but each time, one of them would try to move forward by sharing their feelings. This was really the best strategy for Pei Wenxuan to win Li Rong over this time round.With the romance underplayed during the last quarter, the show put a heavier focus on palace and court politics, which I also found entertaining. The show emphasized how blood ties and affection would always take second place when it comes to power struggles among the royal and noble families. This drama did a pretty good job depicting how people will stop at nothing to retain power for their family names and were mostly propelled by self-interest. As frustrating as it was to watch, it was understandable given the history of the Chinese empires. At least for me, it gave more depth to many of the characters in this show. It also added more nuances to the relationship between the leads as they navigated conflicts between the royal and noble families and survived being in the center of political struggles and turmoil. Seeing them together left a good feeling, and I was satisfied with how they ended.  **Why Frustrating?**Where the show failed for me and why I could not give it a higher rating was how Su Rong Qing was portrayed. This character got a lot of hate for being the clingy SML who could not move on and later as the main villain, got a lot of screen time. I believe the show wanted to elicit sympathy for him, given his backstory and complicated relationship with Li Rong in the first life. The show probably also wanted a more complex villain whose actions may have seemed rash and selfish at first but never wavered from his desire to protect and ensure the safety and happiness of the ones he loved, including Li Rong. Also, by adding him to the mix, perhaps the show wanted to create more than just a sweet, flat romance between the leads.If a more veteran actor had played the character, I might have developed a soft spot for Su Rong Qing and felt bad for him. However, Chen Heyi's portrayal did nothing for me. At the beginning, I did not really notice him except as a plot device to drive the leads closer. Later, when he turned out to be the main villain, I was not surprised to see him featured more. After all, like many other shows, villains tend to have more screen time during the buildup to the climax to drive up the angst factor. However, never once did I feel sympathy for Su Rong Qing. It could be the writing, but unfortunately, Chen He Yi's acting was not enough to depict this lost soul. Even in the end, I could not feel the hopelessness and defeat that Su Rong Qing must have felt, trapped with no way out between his family, duty, love, and his own desires. Even the music and numerous flashbacks failed to stir any emotions within me.The acting of others also missed the mark for me. The actress playing Consort Rou, for example, had the oddest expressions, almost like she had a constant twitch. For someone who was featured quite a bit, I found it somewhat distracting.**Overall**Despite the lackluster acting of some, I love that the characters were shades of gray. We had antagonists who felt justified in their actions, people on both sides helping each other, sometimes for justice but mostly for purely selfish interests. Then we have the protagonists who made bad decisions, said and did things they did not mean in the heat of the moment. The show scored points with me for its dynamic characters who struggled with their actions, who were not always clear if they were doing the right thing or what the right thing even was.This was certainly not a \"always feel good\" show where the good ones win all the time but it certainly provided the satisfaction I wanted. I was half expecting some open ended dream sequence but the ending was a proper and complete one.Aesthetically, the set designs and costumes were well done and indicated the high budget of the show. The costumes were lovely, especially for Pei Wenxuan, and his clean hairstyle highlighted how handsome he was. The styling for Li Rong and Shangguang Ya was also nicely done, especially their hairstyles and accessories.I also found the OSTs fitting and memorable. For posterity, here is the playlisthttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLaG0k-PXfnd8aOjOOxIaKTGfGdB4VKtm (maintained by Peachy Blossom) or Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/28GuPBlliOm48KGAl2fefJ?si=c8ba7e1257c24081I recommend that you try this drama out and see for yourself. Thematically for me, The Princess Royal is a show that encapsulates life in many aspects and topics. It touches upon self-awareness and personal growth, love (romantic and familial), respect and loyalty (to self, family, country), politics, societal obligations and problems, the balance of power and inequality, friendship, and more.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":8.5}}}</script>

 <p><strong>Entertaining but also frustrating</strong></p>  The Princess Royal turned out to be one of those polarizing dramas where many viewers enjoyed the series thoroughly, while others condemned it as a terrible waste of time. This drama scored higher ratings on Douban than another show with an 8.9 rating on MDL and breached 10,000 on Youku’s popularity index. Yet, if you read the reviews and comments on MDL, you will see many with an opposite sentiment. <br><br>In the beginning, there were folks who judged the FL character based on her actions in the novel, and despite the scenes not even happening in the drama, began hating on her. As the show progressed, some complained that the novel had better scenes and the drama should have included them. Furthermore, fans of Zhang Ling He lamented that his ML character got less screen time than the SML and was not a strong enough character. Others wanted a full-fledged romance story and felt that the show spent too much time on palace politics and the interactions between the FL and the SML.<br><br>Lucky for me, I was not influenced by such factors. Not having read the novel, I could start with a clean slate. Also, not being a major fan of any actor, I was not comparing the amount of screen time each character had. While I enjoyed the development of the leads' romance, I was most interested in seeing how the leads would triumph against the villains when given the opportunity to redo things. The show drew me in because of its interesting premise of giving multiple characters a second chance.<br><br>**Why Entertaining?**<br><br>Having not only one lead but multiple characters being reborn into an earlier period of their lives added a nice twist to the usual story of a second shot at life. Moreover, we got another twist where instead of the ML being the tsundere one with all the power and prestige, it was the FL, Li Rong, who started off with a colder and unapproachable personality. As the Princess Royal, she was the political heavyweight with the backing of her noble family's background. In contrast, Pei Wenxuan, the ML, came from a humble common family and was married to the FL as her Prince Consort.<br><br>I liked Li Rong because she was unlike the stereotypical strong female lead. She had plenty of flaws but also had her own strengths. With conflicting personality traits, she was initially misunderstood by many viewers because she was cold and harsh on the outside towards Pei Wenxuan and yet showed care and thoughtfulness for him through her actions. Those viewers who supported and defended her against criticism finally felt vindicated when Li Rong showed character growth as she learned to trust the ML and revealed a warmer side. Through this growth, Li Rong also became freer, dropped her defensive wall, and expressed her feelings towards Pei Wenxuan more openly.<br><br>What added to her appeal for me was her complicated backstory. In her first life, Li Rong was no Mary Sue; she was not your usual FL who was perfect and good, and her only fault was trusting and loving the wrong people. In Li Rong's case, she was so proud, and her pride led her to misunderstand Pei Wenxuan and cut him off. She ended up in a relationship with Su Rong Qing, the SML, for many years while her marriage to Pei Wenxuan was just a sham. This setup also led many viewers to condemn her, but for me, who cares? The story was about them getting another opportunity to change things and start afresh, so I was more interested in what happened in their present (second) lives.<br><br>Zhao Jinmai did a good job as Li Rong. She was supposed to be young, and she certainly looked the part with her baby face, but she was able to portray the emotions of someone who may look young but had already experienced over 40 years of life. A life that was not easy, being entangled in palace politics. That said, there were times when I thought she was not regal enough and did not give that feeling of gravitas that someone in her position should have.<br><br>As for Zhang Lihe, whether or not he got sufficient screentime, I don't think anyone can deny that he found his stride in this drama. This is his best ML role so far, and he completely embodied Pei Wenxuan as a sunny, besotted man who was also calculating. Pei Wenxuan was also prideful like Li Rong in his first life as her Prince Consort, and when given another chance, decided not to waste it by hiding his love for Li Rong like he did the first time. In the second life, he wore his heart on his sleeve, and having understood Li Rong so well, was patient and willing to bear a lot for her. To me, he was an endearing simp who had it bad for Li Rong but was not a wimp. He got things done in his own way and was a brilliant strategist with his political maneuvering. He could also outshine anyone, including Su Rong Qing, during his jealous fits. Minor spoiler alert: the scene where he played the erhu in the middle of Li Rong's and Su Rong Qing's performance was just the best.<br><br>I enjoyed the progression of their relationship in the second life. Mostly through Pei Wenxuan's efforts, the leads actually talked through their issues. It took them the whole of their first lifetime to second-guess, and ultimately scheme against each other, so the second time around, they made sure to communicate. There were times when I thought there would be misunderstandings again, but each time, one of them would try to move forward by sharing their feelings. This was really the best strategy for Pei Wenxuan to win Li Rong over this time round.<br><br>With the romance underplayed during the last quarter, the show put a heavier focus on palace and court politics, which I also found entertaining. The show emphasized how blood ties and affection would always take second place when it comes to power struggles among the royal and noble families. This drama did a pretty good job depicting how people will stop at nothing to retain power for their family names and were mostly propelled by self-interest. As frustrating as it was to watch, it was understandable given the history of the Chinese empires. At least for me, it gave more depth to many of the characters in this show. It also added more nuances to the relationship between the leads as they navigated conflicts between the royal and noble families and survived being in the center of political struggles and turmoil. Seeing them together left a good feeling, and I was satisfied with how they ended.  <br><br>**Why Frustrating?**<br><br>Where the show failed for me and why I could not give it a higher rating was how Su Rong Qing was portrayed. This character got a lot of hate for being the clingy SML who could not move on and later as the main villain, got a lot of screen time. I believe the show wanted to elicit sympathy for him, given his backstory and complicated relationship with Li Rong in the first life. The show probably also wanted a more complex villain whose actions may have seemed rash and selfish at first but never wavered from his desire to protect and ensure the safety and happiness of the ones he loved, including Li Rong. Also, by adding him to the mix, perhaps the show wanted to create more than just a sweet, flat romance between the leads.<br><br>If a more veteran actor had played the character, I might have developed a soft spot for Su Rong Qing and felt bad for him. However, Chen Heyi's portrayal did nothing for me. At the beginning, I did not really notice him except as a plot device to drive the leads closer. Later, when he turned out to be the main villain, I was not surprised to see him featured more. After all, like many other shows, villains tend to have more screen time during the buildup to the climax to drive up the angst factor. However, never once did I feel sympathy for Su Rong Qing. It could be the writing, but unfortunately, Chen He Yi's acting was not enough to depict this lost soul. Even in the end, I could not feel the hopelessness and defeat that Su Rong Qing must have felt, trapped with no way out between his family, duty, love, and his own desires. Even the music and numerous flashbacks failed to stir any emotions within me.<br><br>The acting of others also missed the mark for me. The actress playing Consort Rou, for example, had the oddest expressions, almost like she had a constant twitch. For someone who was featured quite a bit, I found it somewhat distracting.<br><br>**Overall**<br><br>Despite the lackluster acting of some, I love that the characters were shades of gray. We had antagonists who felt justified in their actions, people on both sides helping each other, sometimes for justice but mostly for purely selfish interests. Then we have the protagonists who made bad decisions, said and did things they did not mean in the heat of the moment. The show scored points with me for its dynamic characters who struggled with their actions, who were not always clear if they were doing the right thing or what the right thing even was.<br><br>This was certainly not a "always feel good" show where the good ones win all the time but it certainly provided the satisfaction I wanted. I was half expecting some open ended dream sequence but the ending was a proper and complete one.<br><br>Aesthetically, the set designs and costumes were well done and indicated the high budget of the show. The costumes were lovely, especially for Pei Wenxuan, and his clean hairstyle highlighted how handsome he was. The styling for Li Rong and Shangguang Ya was also nicely done, especially their hairstyles and accessories.<br><br>I also found the OSTs fitting and memorable. For posterity, here is the playlist<br>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLaG0k-PXfnd8aOjOOxIaKTGfGdB4VKtm (maintained by Peachy Blossom) or Spotify: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/28GuPBlliOm48KGAl2fefJ?si=c8ba7e1257c24081<br><br>I recommend that you try this drama out and see for yourself. Thematically for me, The Princess Royal is a show that encapsulates life in many aspects and topics. It touches upon self-awareness and personal growth, love (romantic and familial), respect and loyalty (to self, family, country), politics, societal obligations and problems, the balance of power and inequality, friendship, and more.  <p class="read-more"><a href="#" class="button">Read More</a></p>  <div class="review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t"> <div class="review-vote review-helpful-375037"><span class="text-muted">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class="btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="375037" data-label="Yes"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="375037" data-label="No"><span>No</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote" data-id="375037"><span>Cancel</span></button>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-gift-award" data-id="375037"></button>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>

To me, he was there for the plot and did not take away from my enjoyment of this drama. Focus on the main couple and you will enjoy it. <br><br>*Except for a few specific chapters, I did not read the novel. <br>*The review is based on the drama. <br>*I went in with no expectations other than great acting and chemistry, but I understand the novel readers' frustration with any adaptations. <br><br>What I love most about The Princess Royal is the main couple. Both Li Rong and Pei Wen Xuan died on the same day thinking one killed the other. They are taken back in time to when LR was 18 and PWX was 20. Both were married in their previous lifetime but lived apart due to a misunderstanding.  The first 2 episodes are tough to watch due to the way LR bullies PWX because she thinks he killed her. Thank goodness that was cleared up quickly. The misunderstanding that caused their separation was cleared up by episode 11 and from there, the couple starts to grow closer as they try to discover who was behind LR's death. By the time you get to episode 12, you will have a better understanding about LR and PWX's viewpoint on their relationship. I wish I could say it was all settled by then but it will take time for LR to admit her love fully. Be patient. The ride is entertaining. There are comical moments, frustrations, and sweet moments. <br><br>The chemistry between LR and PWX is unique. They are like old married couples. They bicker, but they understand each other. In one sense, they are comfortable with each other, but LR is not ready to trust her heart to anyone yet. However, it was clear to me by the little things she did that she cared deeply for her husband. On the other hand, PWX has no qualms about showing his affection. But he is also capable of petty jealousy that you will be sure to find entertaining. Nobody does petty jealousy like Zhang Ling He! I loved watching this couple especially when it became clear they loved each other. <br><br>This is one of the best cp I have seen. Jin Mai and ZLH were outstanding with their depiction of a couple who was on the one hand familiar with each other and acted like old married couples sleeping next to each other and knowing what each other needs and wants, but on the other hand getting to know each other as they came to realize the misunderstanding that caused their separation.<br><br><br>The FL, Li Rong,  is a complex character due to who she is. She is THE Princess Royal raised to view marriage and love in a way that makes her more restrained and unwilling to trust. And yet her character possesses kindness and empathy for others.  There are some viewers who do not like LR. They believe she is a stupid FL. I DISAGREE!  She is not perfect, but I like her. She doesn't always make the right decisions, but she is in no way an evil person. She is caring and strives to improve the lives of the common people. She is proud. She grew up in a royal family where everyone had an ulterior motive. And even though she seems to reject getting closer to PWX, she constantly seeks reassurance that he will always be by her side. Her actions are not because she is stupid. She is the way she is because her trust issues are from a deep and complex place. Lucky LR that she has her Prince Consort..her love, Pei Wen Xuan! She appreciates him and in a rare moment told him, "....let me tell you, you do not need to compare yourself to anyone, let alone Su Rong Qing."<br><br>The ML, Pei Wen Xuan, is the Prince Consort. Zhang Ling He played his role in such a way I was able to see him as an intelligent man who is a strategist with a high IQ and EQ as well as a patient and understanding man.  He is the perfect match for Li Rong. She comes to lean on him when at times she needs support. PWX is my favorite character in this drama. As a husband if only a nominal one at first, he wants LR's happiness and will do anything he can to help her. But he will also point out her mistakes quite vehemently at times and patiently at other times. And he also has another side. While he appears soft when he is around LR, he is also commanding, confident, and fearless especially when he must defend his princess. He has the greatest lines. Many times I found myself going back to listen to his words: <br><br><br>"Either I  die with you, or take you home."<br><br>" As a husband, no one can touch you unless someone steps over my dead body. As your ally, I'll stand in front of you even if you're cut in pieces. So whether we are husband and wife or allies, our fate has long been tied together."<br><br><br><br>The Princess Royal is filled with romance and palace intrigue. It is a story of a second chance in life, acceptance and forgiveness, trust and love.  The question of who to trust is a recurring theme. It was surprising to me to see the emperor hesitate to eat pastries brought to him by his daughter, LR. It is no wonder LR has trust issues.  By the end of the drama the only person she could trust was her husband, PWX. And even when trust is betrayed, it is possible to forgive when given the chance to change your life. <br><br>ADDITIONAL COMMENTS<br> Some viewers feel that the SML is actually the ML.  I disagree. Pei Wen Xuan is very much present and the ML! The SML became more visible in the second half of the drama when the plot picked up concerning the details of who killed LR and the truth about the SML and his part in her death. How else is the drama supposed to head into resolution without addressing the SML's part? Perhaps it is because I was fully invested in this couple and was totally convinced of their love for each other that I did not feel frustrated with the presence of the SML.   He became annoying and frustrating to watch, but this did not take away from my enjoyment of the main leads. I enjoyed The Princess Royal because I watched it for LR and PWX. <br><br>SPOILER BELOW ON EPISODE 40!<br><br>However, I also understand the disappointment of viewers with the final episode. The screenwriter chose to use the final episode as Su Rong Qing's grand farewell. Understandably, SRQ must explain his actions. And perhaps the producer wanted to emphasize all that he has lost with flashbacks to his previous life with LR. And perhaps pity was the emotional reaction this producer sought. While I can see the focus and understand the motives, I felt it went too far and showed too much. Some of it was cringy. But while many dropped ratings due to this, I did not because there were so many more beautiful scenes and outstanding performances to make The Royal Princess a drama I will rewatch. Would I have liked to have seen less of the SML in the final episode and more of LR and PWX? Absolutely! But I was happy with the outcome and the happy ending. Even better, there is a bonus episode!  <p class="read-more"><a href="#" class="button">Read More</a></p>  <div class="review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t"> <div class="review-vote review-helpful-374847"><span class="text-muted">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class="btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="374847" data-label="Yes"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="374847" data-label="No"><span>No</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote" data-id="374847"><span>Cancel</span></button>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-gift-award" data-id="374847"></button>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
