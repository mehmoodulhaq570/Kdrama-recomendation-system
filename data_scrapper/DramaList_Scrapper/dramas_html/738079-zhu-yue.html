The drama delves not just into the main leads core but it weaves a series of stories together bringing out different degrees of emotions. While swirling on these emotions, the visually colorful cinematography, set design, and distinct character costumes accompanied by addictive OSTs formulates for an enthralling experience.The heart of Moonlight Mystique lies in its tale about a love that transcends beyond the moon. It takes you to dive deep into a journey which highlights the unspeakable power of the intangible vastness of love in its variousness ; may it be friendship love, familial love, romantic love or self-love, no matter what shape or form, in the end it truly is love that conquers all.STORYLINE\u208a \u22b9\u2740The drama begins with an eye-catching animation to introduce the main characters which has never been done in a xianxia genre drama before. I found such creative presentation to be captivating that it drew me over instantly. The story takes its first step when a mortal named Bai Shuo who had spent her entire childhood seeking ways to become an immortal out of gratitude for her benefactor met the Demon King of the Bright Moon Palace, Fan Yue who is well-known for his viciousness and feared by many. The supposed simple interaction between the two unexpectedly turned into a complicated entanglement because of the sudden activation of the contemplation stone which later led to a tragic event that turned Bai Shuo's initial reason for seeking immortality into revenge. The notable early setup of angst in the story left an impact for its great execution of emotions across the screen. The drama definitely made a strong start. As Bai Shuo and Fan Yue ventures out to different places in search for the remaining contemplations, the story flows more progressively leaving no room for dullness as every episode is packed with multiple events. The utilization of backstories for each character that both Bai Shuo and Fan Yue encounters speaks about the stark contrast between the colorful and vibrant visual presentation of each scene to how the narrative of the story actually leaps into a complete emotional roller coaster ride. At first it might seem underwhelming since these backstories are merely about the supporting characters, however they added depth into the story because of how they seamlessly tie into the main plot.As the drama moves to the second half, the core essence of the story which lies in the contemplation stone unfolds its edge to be the love story between the main characters and their intertwined fate. I thought that the romantic development of Bai Shuo and Fan Yue's relationship was really well-written. I love the gradual transition of their relationship from not having trust and merely using each other into forming a tacit-understanding and strong affection for each other. What makes it even more interesting is how Bai Shuo and Fan Yue's relationship is depicted to be a healthy bond where they communicate and consistently trust one another, giving no opportunity for any misunderstandings - it greatly highlights the dramas uniqueness as a xianxia. Moreover, the execution of the main characters romantic and intimate scenes was done in an exceptionally beautiful way that they made for a memorable moment. The romance aspect between the main couple is definitely one of the dramas outstanding point. Opposite to the main couples dynamic is the toxic type of bond between the second leads, Fu Ling and Chong Zhao. Although I wasn't completely invested in their love story as I found the romantic development between them to be weak, they still are an entertaining pair.The unexpected plot twist about the characters connection with each other and their cohesively written backstories for these connections allowed viewers to easily step into each of these characters point of views - the unlikable characters were no exception. They laid out this aspect of the drama properly that the initial judgement for a character can turn into empathy and sympathy once their past is revealed. It makes viewers connect with the characters they least expect to connect with. Apart from Bai Shuo and Fan Yue's growth throughout their journey after facing countless of challenges and setbacks together, the supporting characters, even the antagonist Fu Ling and Chen Ye were given evident character development too. The character development is flawless and satisfyingly done. As for the well built foundation for the redemption arc of the main characters siblings, it resulted into justifiable outcomes. No character death was left to be in vain as they were in time proven to serve their own purpose and meaning. These elements proved to be the dramas other strengths as well.The best and most intense part of the story was saved for the last - the God Arc. This arc only took a few episodes to be told but it can be considered as a spotlight stealer for how impressively intriguing the romantic tale of Xing Yue and Jing Yuan was. This revelation nearing the end about their tragic past being the reason for their intertwined fate enhanced the love story between Bai Shuo and Fan Yue, it made their story more enriched and profound as it showed the limitless and unconditional love they have for each other that it transcended through lifetimes. The ending was wrapped up with no loose ends. When the present Bai Shuo and Fan Yue faced these tragic fate again, this time they were given a better ending for their story because of how great their love for each other is. I thought their love story perfectly answers the question: \"what would you do for love?\". The special episode provided made the conclusion of the ending of their story even more significant. I couldn't have asked for a better ending.I had no problem with the colorful cinematography and CGI effect of the drama. It is aesthetically pleasing and further makes Moonlight Mystique stand out on its own. The well-detailed costumes and carefully coordinated color schemes that were tailored very distinctively to suit each character in the drama deserves praise for how gorgeous they turned out to be and fits all the casts visuals well. Certainly these elements had played a part in making the drama even more captivating. CHARACTERS & ACTING\u208a \u22b9\u2740Bai Lu as Bai Shuo | Xing YueBai Shuo was initially a flawed character who was stubborn and lacks understanding of others because she grew up pampered by her father's love. Her formed beliefs and views about the world were limited as her experiences only came from the fictional books that she reads. She later learned the harsh realities and hard truth when great pain was implanted in her heart. After experiencing countless of tragedies and obstacles during her journey to seek revenge, she begins to grow into a very admirable character. She later became more mature and powerful as each collection of a new contemplation became an enlightenment for her. Her true strength lies in her unwavering determination, resilience and perseverance. No matter what situation came her way, she faced them bravely. Even if she knows there is no path for her to take, she doesn't back down but instead creates her own path. She is a strong and smart female lead.Xing Yue on the other hand is the powerful goddess of the stars and moon, she wields the divine bow which is deemed to be the most powerful weapon in the entire divine realm. She served as its main protector and the reason why there was peace that existed during those times. Although she is immensely powerful, the expense for her strength is that she is devoid of all her emotions making her live a lifeless life with a cold and unapproachable exterior. Her greatest catastrophe was when she learned how to love and be loved. Xing Yue and Bai Shuo have their differences but their bravery and great love speaks for both their characters.Bai Lu brilliantly shined in her acting performance for how magnificently she portrayed her character as Bai Shuo and Xing Yue. Her acting is very convincing and allows viewers to connect with her emotions as she effortlessly executed these emotions through her facial expressions and eyes. Furthermore, the fact that she had dubbed her own characters voice had totally enriched her delivery as these emotions are prominent even in her voice. She definitely acted the life out of her characters. More of her versatility as an actress was showcased in this drama through her different roles, from being A Wu, Xing Yue or even the body swap with Luan Zhu. Her talent and skills in acting is definitely worthy of recognition and praise.Ao Rui Peng as Fan Yue | Jing YuanFan Yue is a character with a tragic past who chose to create a facade of being vicious in order to protect himself. His strong determination to seek revenge resulted in his early success of becoming the Demon King of the Bright Moon Palace. He managed to achieve such a feat by cultivating a secret technique, however attaining its power came with a price which he paid for. In the beginning, Fan Yue seemed aloof who had no care for worldly affairs except for his own personal goals. It was through his constant interaction with Bai Shuo that showed more about his character. He had never hesitated in saving her whenever she is in trouble regardless if he was merely just using her. He showed outmost care for Bai Shuo and became someone who guided her along their journey. His character embodies cleverness, maturity, wise views and kindness although  the trait that made him stand out more is his selfless acts and selfless love.Jing Yuan is a powerful demon lord who ruled in the light of the purple moon, he disguised himself as a divine attendant in order to steal the divine bow. Upon his supposed quest, he fell in love with Xing Yue. He willingly spent 100 years together with Xing Yue. When a rift was formed between them, he never grew to actually hate Xing Yue. His love for her was very deep and pure that even after his own demise, he still found ways to search for her remaining pieces. Contrary to Fan Yue's seriousness, Jing Yuan is a much more playful character but both of them align when it comes to their selflessness, they would willingly do everything for the person they love even at the expense of their own life. Ao Rui Peng's potrayal of Fan Yue and Jing Yuan had proven how he was made for this role. His acting ability is praise worthy. I found no problems with his acting performance as he delivered his characters well. What I loved most about his performance is his ability to form an evident distinct contrast between the two characters he played - it clearly felt like it was acted by different actors. He owns characters with playful traits but no doubt the ones with seriousness suits him a lot too. It has been a long time since I had last watched him act on screen, I am proud to see his growth and improvement as an actor through this drama. Dai Lu Wa as Fu Ling | Bai XiFu Ling is one of the antagonist who loyally serves and follows Zhen Yu's orders. She is a vile villain who ruthlessly kills without a single hesitation as she finds enjoyment rather than remorse in killing. Her character has made countless of unjustifiable and viscous acts that it is understandable if viewers find her unlikable and irredeemable. Towards the end of the drama upon the revelation of her true identity and past life, it was only then that her character was able to show remorse.Dai Lu Wa did a commendable job in her acting performance as Fu Ling. I thought she shined more in her role as a villain compared to a good role like Bai Xi. The fact alone that she was able to make viewers dislike her character shows how she convincingly played her role. Chang Hua Sen as Chong Zhao | Mo LiChong Zhao is a righteous character who seeks justice without hesitation, one thing about him though is his selfishness and prejudice against other races. In his eyes, it is only the eternals that makes for the good while the rest can be nothing but evil. His views are often corrupt and his ways of saving a loved one can be seen to be rather for selfish motives as he can easily put aside the rest on the line - including Bai Shuo's father who raised him - for the sake of fulfilling his goals. His character came off as hypocritical in earlier episodes for how he constantly fails to understand Bai Shuo. Some can find his character to be annoying although eventually he did have a character development, his prejudice was dissolved and he was able to grasp a better view about the so-called eternals he thinks highly of.Chang Hua Sen didn't disappoint with his acting and similarly, I thought that he shined more as Mo Li a villain compared to his character as Chong Zhao. I was able to see more of his facial expressions through his portrayal of Mo Li and it certainly left an impression. OthersLiang Xue Feng portrayal of Chen Ye and Qi Feng had caught my attention. He did a wonderful job especially in his emotional scenes with Fan Yue. Quan Yi Lun as Rong Xian and Zuo Ye as A Qi didn't fall behind for their noticeable delivery of emotions too.OSTs\u208a \u22b9\u2740The songs were no doubt mesmerizing and emotionally evoking. The maximize usage of Sa Ding Ding's ost \"Flowers Fall With No Trace\" to every angsty, sad, or tragic scenes helped heightened the delivery of emotions in those scenes making it even more painful and heart wrenching to watch. Her vocals held so much power and feelings that I easily connected with her song. Zhou Shen's ost \"Embrace and Never Let Go\" left a lingering impact and surely carried out the main couples love for each other across the screen for how sweetly and prettily it was sang. OVERALL IMPRESSION\u208a \u22b9\u2740Moonlight Mystique is a xianxia drama like no other, the different elements it had brought out clearly left a new experience for this type of genre. The stunning tale about the unconditional and boundless love between Bai Shuo and Fan Yue - even Xing Yue and Jing Yuan, had left a great impact for how profound it was written. It is also refreshing to see this type of romantic relationship between the main characters in this genre, this drama proved that it can still tell a compelling story without the need for unnecessary misunderstandings. The undeniable chemistry between Bai Lu and Ao Rui Peng is certainly impressive. All the actors and crew involved in this has done a splendid job, the efforts and hard work they put into creating this drama definitely did not go to waste. The whole journey has been absolutely worthwhile.FAVE SCENES\u208a \u22b9\u2740- Jing Yuan's majestic entrance when he descended down the purple moon- Bai Shuo and Fan Yue's first meeting at the Unbridled Pavillion- The story about Rong Xian and Ling Long inside the resentment arc- Fan Yue's amnesia that turned him into the adorable 'Mu Mu'- Every scene of Bai Shuo when a new contemplation is being collected- Bai Shuo wearing a red hanfu fighting against Zhen Yu- Bai Shuo and Bai Xi's reunion- Qi Feng's fist bump on Fan Yue's chest during his last moment- Entire romantic moment between Fan Yue and Bai Shuo- The story of Xing Yue and Jing Yuan\u02d6 . \u0741\u2740\ud835\udf17\ud835\udf1a\u2740. \u0741\u208a\"May I be like the stars and you like the moon.

Compelling Tale About Love That Transcends Beyond The Moon</strong></p>  "Moonlight Mystique" adapted from the novel titled 'Bai Shuo Shang Shen' which translates to "Chasing The Moon" is a xianxia drama that stands out because of its unique elements, leading for an unforgettable watch that certainly leaves a mark of its own. The drama delves not just into the main leads core but it weaves a series of stories together bringing out different degrees of emotions. While swirling on these emotions, the visually colorful cinematography, set design, and distinct character costumes accompanied by addictive OSTs formulates for an enthralling experience.<br><br>The heart of Moonlight Mystique lies in its tale about a love that transcends beyond the moon. It takes you to dive deep into a journey which highlights the unspeakable power of the intangible vastness of love in its variousness ; may it be friendship love, familial love, romantic love or self-love, no matter what shape or form, in the end it truly is love that conquers all.<br><br>STORYLINE₊ ⊹❀<br>The drama begins with an eye-catching animation to introduce the main characters which has never been done in a xianxia genre drama before. I found such creative presentation to be captivating that it drew me over instantly. The story takes its first step when a mortal named Bai Shuo who had spent her entire childhood seeking ways to become an immortal out of gratitude for her benefactor met the Demon King of the Bright Moon Palace, Fan Yue who is well-known for his viciousness and feared by many. The supposed simple interaction between the two unexpectedly turned into a complicated entanglement because of the sudden activation of the contemplation stone which later led to a tragic event that turned Bai Shuo's initial reason for seeking immortality into revenge. <br><br>The notable early setup of angst in the story left an impact for its great execution of emotions across the screen. The drama definitely made a strong start. As Bai Shuo and Fan Yue ventures out to different places in search for the remaining contemplations, the story flows more progressively leaving no room for dullness as every episode is packed with multiple events. The utilization of backstories for each character that both Bai Shuo and Fan Yue encounters speaks about the stark contrast between the colorful and vibrant visual presentation of each scene to how the narrative of the story actually leaps into a complete emotional roller coaster ride. At first it might seem underwhelming since these backstories are merely about the supporting characters, however they added depth into the story because of how they seamlessly tie into the main plot.<br><br>As the drama moves to the second half, the core essence of the story which lies in the contemplation stone unfolds its edge to be the love story between the main characters and their intertwined fate. I thought that the romantic development of Bai Shuo and Fan Yue's relationship was really well-written. I love the gradual transition of their relationship from not having trust and merely using each other into forming a tacit-understanding and strong affection for each other. What makes it even more interesting is how Bai Shuo and Fan Yue's relationship is depicted to be a healthy bond where they communicate and consistently trust one another, giving no opportunity for any misunderstandings - it greatly highlights the dramas uniqueness as a xianxia. Moreover, the execution of the main characters romantic and intimate scenes was done in an exceptionally beautiful way that they made for a memorable moment. The romance aspect between the main couple is definitely one of the dramas outstanding point. Opposite to the main couples dynamic is the toxic type of bond between the second leads, Fu Ling and Chong Zhao. Although I wasn't completely invested in their love story as I found the romantic development between them to be weak, they still are an entertaining pair.<br><br>The unexpected plot twist about the characters connection with each other and their cohesively written backstories for these connections allowed viewers to easily step into each of these characters point of views - the unlikable characters were no exception. They laid out this aspect of the drama properly that the initial judgement for a character can turn into empathy and sympathy once their past is revealed. It makes viewers connect with the characters they least expect to connect with. Apart from Bai Shuo and Fan Yue's growth throughout their journey after facing countless of challenges and setbacks together, the supporting characters, even the antagonist Fu Ling and Chen Ye were given evident character development too. The character development is flawless and satisfyingly done. As for the well built foundation for the redemption arc of the main characters siblings, it resulted into justifiable outcomes. No character death was left to be in vain as they were in time proven to serve their own purpose and meaning. These elements proved to be the dramas other strengths as well.<br><br>The best and most intense part of the story was saved for the last - the God Arc. This arc only took a few episodes to be told but it can be considered as a spotlight stealer for how impressively intriguing the romantic tale of Xing Yue and Jing Yuan was. This revelation nearing the end about their tragic past being the reason for their intertwined fate enhanced the love story between Bai Shuo and Fan Yue, it made their story more enriched and profound as it showed the limitless and unconditional love they have for each other that it transcended through lifetimes. The ending was wrapped up with no loose ends. When the present Bai Shuo and Fan Yue faced these tragic fate again, this time they were given a better ending for their story because of how great their love for each other is. I thought their love story perfectly answers the question: "what would you do for love?". The special episode provided made the conclusion of the ending of their story even more significant. I couldn't have asked for a better ending.<br><br>I had no problem with the colorful cinematography and CGI effect of the drama. It is aesthetically pleasing and further makes Moonlight Mystique stand out on its own. The well-detailed costumes and carefully coordinated color schemes that were tailored very distinctively to suit each character in the drama deserves praise for how gorgeous they turned out to be and fits all the casts visuals well. Certainly these elements had played a part in making the drama even more captivating.<br> <br>CHARACTERS &amp; ACTING₊ ⊹❀<br>Bai Lu as Bai Shuo | Xing Yue<br>Bai Shuo was initially a flawed character who was stubborn and lacks understanding of others because she grew up pampered by her father's love. Her formed beliefs and views about the world were limited as her experiences only came from the fictional books that she reads. She later learned the harsh realities and hard truth when great pain was implanted in her heart. After experiencing countless of tragedies and obstacles during her journey to seek revenge, she begins to grow into a very admirable character. She later became more mature and powerful as each collection of a new contemplation became an enlightenment for her. Her true strength lies in her unwavering determination, resilience and perseverance. No matter what situation came her way, she faced them bravely. Even if she knows there is no path for her to take, she doesn't back down but instead creates her own path. She is a strong and smart female lead.<br><br>Xing Yue on the other hand is the powerful goddess of the stars and moon, she wields the divine bow which is deemed to be the most powerful weapon in the entire divine realm. She served as its main protector and the reason why there was peace that existed during those times. Although she is immensely powerful, the expense for her strength is that she is devoid of all her emotions making her live a lifeless life with a cold and unapproachable exterior. Her greatest catastrophe was when she learned how to love and be loved. Xing Yue and Bai Shuo have their differences but their bravery and great love speaks for both their characters.<br><br>Bai Lu brilliantly shined in her acting performance for how magnificently she portrayed her character as Bai Shuo and Xing Yue. Her acting is very convincing and allows viewers to connect with her emotions as she effortlessly executed these emotions through her facial expressions and eyes. Furthermore, the fact that she had dubbed her own characters voice had totally enriched her delivery as these emotions are prominent even in her voice. She definitely acted the life out of her characters. More of her versatility as an actress was showcased in this drama through her different roles, from being A Wu, Xing Yue or even the body swap with Luan Zhu. Her talent and skills in acting is definitely worthy of recognition and praise.<br><br>Ao Rui Peng as Fan Yue | Jing Yuan<br>Fan Yue is a character with a tragic past who chose to create a facade of being vicious in order to protect himself. His strong determination to seek revenge resulted in his early success of becoming the Demon King of the Bright Moon Palace. He managed to achieve such a feat by cultivating a secret technique, however attaining its power came with a price which he paid for. In the beginning, Fan Yue seemed aloof who had no care for worldly affairs except for his own personal goals. It was through his constant interaction with Bai Shuo that showed more about his character. He had never hesitated in saving her whenever she is in trouble regardless if he was merely just using her. He showed outmost care for Bai Shuo and became someone who guided her along their journey. His character embodies cleverness, maturity, wise views and kindness although  the trait that made him stand out more is his selfless acts and selfless love.<br><br>Jing Yuan is a powerful demon lord who ruled in the light of the purple moon, he disguised himself as a divine attendant in order to steal the divine bow. Upon his supposed quest, he fell in love with Xing Yue. He willingly spent 100 years together with Xing Yue. When a rift was formed between them, he never grew to actually hate Xing Yue. His love for her was very deep and pure that even after his own demise, he still found ways to search for her remaining pieces. Contrary to Fan Yue's seriousness, Jing Yuan is a much more playful character but both of them align when it comes to their selflessness, they would willingly do everything for the person they love even at the expense of their own life. <br><br>Ao Rui Peng's potrayal of Fan Yue and Jing Yuan had proven how he was made for this role. His acting ability is praise worthy. I found no problems with his acting performance as he delivered his characters well. What I loved most about his performance is his ability to form an evident distinct contrast between the two characters he played - it clearly felt like it was acted by different actors. He owns characters with playful traits but no doubt the ones with seriousness suits him a lot too. It has been a long time since I had last watched him act on screen, I am proud to see his growth and improvement as an actor through this drama. <br><br>Dai Lu Wa as Fu Ling | Bai Xi<br>Fu Ling is one of the antagonist who loyally serves and follows Zhen Yu's orders. She is a vile villain who ruthlessly kills without a single hesitation as she finds enjoyment rather than remorse in killing. Her character has made countless of unjustifiable and viscous acts that it is understandable if viewers find her unlikable and irredeemable. Towards the end of the drama upon the revelation of her true identity and past life, it was only then that her character was able to show remorse.<br><br>Dai Lu Wa did a commendable job in her acting performance as Fu Ling. I thought she shined more in her role as a villain compared to a good role like Bai Xi. The fact alone that she was able to make viewers dislike her character shows how she convincingly played her role. <br><br>Chang Hua Sen as Chong Zhao | Mo Li<br>Chong Zhao is a righteous character who seeks justice without hesitation, one thing about him though is his selfishness and prejudice against other races. In his eyes, it is only the eternals that makes for the good while the rest can be nothing but evil. His views are often corrupt and his ways of saving a loved one can be seen to be rather for selfish motives as he can easily put aside the rest on the line - including Bai Shuo's father who raised him - for the sake of fulfilling his goals. His character came off as hypocritical in earlier episodes for how he constantly fails to understand Bai Shuo. Some can find his character to be annoying although eventually he did have a character development, his prejudice was dissolved and he was able to grasp a better view about the so-called eternals he thinks highly of.<br><br>Chang Hua Sen didn't disappoint with his acting and similarly, I thought that he shined more as Mo Li a villain compared to his character as Chong Zhao. I was able to see more of his facial expressions through his portrayal of Mo Li and it certainly left an impression. <br><br>Others<br>Liang Xue Feng portrayal of Chen Ye and Qi Feng had caught my attention. He did a wonderful job especially in his emotional scenes with Fan Yue. Quan Yi Lun as Rong Xian and Zuo Ye as A Qi didn't fall behind for their noticeable delivery of emotions too.<br><br>OSTs₊ ⊹❀<br>The songs were no doubt mesmerizing and emotionally evoking. The maximize usage of Sa Ding Ding's ost "Flowers Fall With No Trace" to every angsty, sad, or tragic scenes helped heightened the delivery of emotions in those scenes making it even more painful and heart wrenching to watch. Her vocals held so much power and feelings that I easily connected with her song. Zhou Shen's ost "Embrace and Never Let Go" left a lingering impact and surely carried out the main couples love for each other across the screen for how sweetly and prettily it was sang. <br><br>OVERALL IMPRESSION₊ ⊹❀<br>Moonlight Mystique is a xianxia drama like no other, the different elements it had brought out clearly left a new experience for this type of genre. The stunning tale about the unconditional and boundless love between Bai Shuo and Fan Yue - even Xing Yue and Jing Yuan, had left a great impact for how profound it was written. It is also refreshing to see this type of romantic relationship between the main characters in this genre, this drama proved that it can still tell a compelling story without the need for unnecessary misunderstandings. <br><br>The undeniable chemistry between Bai Lu and Ao Rui Peng is certainly impressive. All the actors and crew involved in this has done a splendid job, the efforts and hard work they put into creating this drama definitely did not go to waste. The whole journey has been absolutely worthwhile.<br><br>FAVE SCENES₊ ⊹❀<br>- Jing Yuan's majestic entrance when he descended down the purple moon<br>- Bai Shuo and Fan Yue's first meeting at the Unbridled Pavillion<br>- The story about Rong Xian and Ling Long inside the resentment arc<br>- Fan Yue's amnesia that turned him into the adorable 'Mu Mu'<br>- Every scene of Bai Shuo when a new contemplation is being collected<br>- Bai Shuo wearing a red hanfu fighting against Zhen Yu<br>- Bai Shuo and Bai Xi's reunion<br>- Qi Feng's fist bump on Fan Yue's chest during his last moment<br>- Entire romantic moment between Fan Yue and Bai Shuo<br>- The story of Xing Yue and Jing Yuan<br><br>˖ . ݁❀❀. ݁₊<br><br>"May I be like the stars and you like the moon.

After watching this drama as a whole, I can tell you that Moonlight Mystique has the least(almost-to-none) connection to Ancient Love Poetry, so this can be regarded as a standalone drama/story featuring Fan Yue/Jing Yuan and Bai Shuo/Xing Yue.<br><br>So you don't really need to watch Ancient Love Poetry to understand the backstory since it was changed completely. MM doesn't feature the god realm, and has no relation/connection to the original backstory for Tian Qi and Yuemi in Ancient Love Poetry. <br><br>Instead of the God Realm(ALP), in MM, this was changed to the 3 Divine Realm: Lunar (Govern by Goddess Xing Yue), Demon (Govern by Demon God Jing Yuan) and Hidden (Govern by the Hidden God Mo Li). <br><br>Before Jing Yuan and Xing Yue backstory was revealed, I didn't know it would be like this out of all my speculation, but it actually turned out to be so different than what I imagined their backstory to be like. I really love the playful and silly side to Jing Yuan from back then (60,000 years ago), because one way or another, I still like to find some references that will tie back to his original character in ALP (Tian Qi). So with this being said, I am glad his character somewhat stayed true in that sense that Jing Yuan is not afraid to confess his love/feelings to the woman he loves, in this case it is Xing Yue and I love that. In it's originality, Tian Qi is someone who will choose to protect the woman he loves first before the three realms. He would go that far to just protect that one person. I'm glad to see that Fan Yue/Jing Yuan is the same, in that sense where he will always choose to protect Bai Shuo/Xing Yue first. These are traits and qualities that I'm glad they kept to the original in MM. <br><br>But in MM, I am glad that we get to see that this is being directed at someone like Bai Shuo who can return his love equally. He deserves to be love. They both deserve their happy ever after at the end of all this. I am glad they got this happy ending in the end. <br><br>The God Realm is my favourite arc, although it was short but their backstory truly touched my heart and made me fell in love with Jing Yuan and Xing Yue back story. <br><br>Even when the story to MM was changed completely from their original backstory for Tian Qi and Yuemi, please don't let this discouraged you from watching Moonlight Mystique though, because I can assure you that the journey for our beloved main character: Fan Yue and Bai Shuo and this beautiful pairing is very worth it in the end! <br><br>While from ALP fans perspective (since I am also ALP fan), I get why fans want some form of connection back to the original story too. Since that is where their backstory started.<br><br>But from the writing perspective, for fans who never got exposed to their backstory and watch this as a standalone, they probably don't want to see Jing Yuan(Tian Qi) loving someone else in the past and Xing Yue(Yue Mi) being hurt by this unrequited love in the process.<br><br>To me, the change has its pros and cons. The change was done better for Tian Qi part for me but cant say the same for Yuemi with what was portrayed in their backstory revealed as Xing Yue and Jing Yuan in the past. Since Yuemi will never hurt Tian Qi on her end. But as we have seen from their past; despite they love each other, they cannot be together, and this leads to their tragic ending, which is very sad. I love how they made it clear/explained that Jing Yuan have been searching for Xing Yue on his end, and I find their story to be somewhat bittersweet in that sense. I actually wrote up my feelings in this thread in here, if you're interested in reading: https://mydramalist.com/discussions/zhu-yue/134640-jing-yuan-and-xing-yue-ending-contain-spoilers <br><br>With that being said, I will add this part to my review as well, I remember when this drama(MM) started airing, I told my online friend about it, since we both like Tian Qi and Yuemi story in Ancient Love Poetry, and we were talking about the cast selection. When I shared this to my online friend about the actress Bai Lu in this drama; he made a comment saying if I can still watch Bai Lu? Since he knows how I feel about her, and if I am going to be honest with you, her character Li Su Su in Till the end of the Moon had really traumatized me to the point there was a period of time, I cannot watch any of her drama's at all. I remember back then(when MM was still airing in the early episodes) my reply to my online friend was: "At the end, Bai Lu can either have two outcome for me, she either will go into my blacklist if she turned out to be another character I don't like in this one by traumatizing me once again, OR her character in this drama (Moonlight Mystique) will heal my previous trauma of her character in Till the End of the Moon. So in the end, what I can say is, I am glad I gave her this benefit of the doubt, while it is true that I started off neutral with her, but her character growth/journey and her portrayal in Bai Shuo or Xing Yue had really won me over and made me became a fan of her as the story progresses, although I love Bai Shuo better because her character is written more to the way of my liking. Bai Lu have done an excellent job bringing out the character: Bai Shuo and Xing Yue to life. I like how she played out the emotional scenes, and her crying scenes didn't feel force but genuine. I like that because it makes it more impactful when I watch those scenes. <br><br>As for Male lead actor goes, I have never seen Ao Rui Peng in another drama before, and the irony was while I have watched a few episodes of Blood of Youth back then, his character didn't stand out to me in that drama, BUT him portraying as Fan Yue and Jing Yuan is just on another level!!! Love him and his make up/costume in this drama. He looks so cool/handsome and especially with the purple shades in his hair when he played as Jing Yuan (The Demon God)!!! Ao Rui Peng whether he is Fan Yue or Jing Yuan, he is very good at playing out these emotional scenes as well. He also has a very passionate chemistry with Bai Shuo/Xing Yue (played by Bai Lu). I love all their screen time together onscreen, and their interactions is just a delight to watch, even at the beginning! There is never a boring moment when they're onscreen! They are definitely noted down as my favourite couple of all time, as a matter of fact, I think I am bumping Fan Yue and Bai Shuo up as my  no.1 favourite Xianxia CP! <br><br>When it comes to pairing side of things, I don't think I have ever encountered a pairing that is this healthy, what I mean by healthy is... Both Fan Yue and Bai Shuo, they have communication, they will talk it out and not let it lead to any miscommunication or misunderstanding between them. Communication is the key!!! And Bai Shuo and Fan Yue have this and I am really thankful that they are consistent with this to the end from their characters. This is really refreshing to see, and I really love it. It makes them stand out to be the most well written pairing that have communication that work through things together. Not to mention they definitely have chemistry as a pairing!! Their Kiss scenes makes me blush and I am glad we got these beautiful scenes for our beloved pairing! <br><br>Xianxia is my favourite genre, but if I am going to be honest here, how I feel about xianxia in the overall have been disappointing as time goes by in terms of having a promising start, but a disappointing ending where they recycled the plot about the "responsibility in protecting the three realms". I am honestly at the point where I don't want a love story where the ML have to shoulder that responsibility in choosing to either protect the three realms or the woman he loves. <br><br>I want a love story where the ML choose to put the woman he loves above the 3 realms(or how many ever realms there is). I guess this is why Fan Yue and Bai Shuo love story appeal to me so much, because I see this as a breakthrough to the overused plot of choosing to protect the three realms and carrying that burden on your shoulder and cannot love freely the way you would want to without those responsibilities.<br><br>So going back to my favourite character here, whether it is Fan Yue or Jing Yuan(in MM), he is really a romantic person in my eyes, because he will continue to protect the woman he loves above anything else. I honestly love his love for Bai Shuo/Xing Yue. I LOVE FAN YUE &amp; JING YUAN!<br><br>One of the things that makes Moonlight Mystique(MM) stand out is that there is never a boring moment with the plot that makes it feels like a filler, because each arc has a purpose that tells the story and will connects to the next one, which makes everything come into place at the end. Even when the side character/stories have their own impactful story that was written so well that it made me cry or teary for them, so they really stand out on it's own(in a good way). <br> <br>I love the kids actors who played as Fan Yue and Qi Feng and Bai Shuo and Bai Xi, their backstory played by these little actors where they played their role in the backstory, made the present time more impactful because you know how much has changed between them from back then (as kids) and now (as adults). <br><br>I also want to make a memorable mention on the character Chen Ye, I didn't think I would like him when I first saw him, even when I found him handsome, because he was cold and ruthless, but when his backstory was revealed, I cannot not like him you know. I even love his interactions with Fan Yue and all their screen-time together (because...... I won't spoil the details for you). <br><br>Fu Ling is another character I didn't think I will like, but in the end, she has become a character that I came to like on my end. I also like her love story with Chong Zhao as well. It is quite sad to be honest. Yeah sad, meaning they got a tragic end. <br><br>In terms of ending for Fan Yue and Bai Shuo, I just want to say this, I really love the ending to MM, I was really nervous that it will be a last minute happy ending like ALP or TLI, but I am glad it isn't the case in MM. To be honest, I was already happy with the ending I got from Episode 40 because they get to hug and shared 1 last passionate kiss together, but when they gave us an epilogue to show their wedding at the end, this just makes it more satisfying for me, because I have come to love Fan Yue and Bai Shuo so much. I love them to the point that if their ending is a Open Ending, I don't think I will be able to control my emotions. I mean, I was really disappointed with Song of the Moon(SOTM) Ending which is another Xianxia by IQIYI by cutting out the ending I know was filmed, but they never included this in the epilogue in that drama(SOTM) so this is why in MM, I am happy and over the moon for finally giving us and our beloved pairing Fan Yue and Bai Shuo their happy ending in a satisfying way! They deserve this to be honest!!! Because they have suffered so much from their past as Jing Yuan and Xing Yue!!! <br><br>MM ending is loveable in my eyes because we got a satisfying and conclusive ending for the Main Pairing, and the other side characters was implied and confirmed they will return one day (so that is a hopeful happy ending for our beloved side characters who died for the great cause). The writers didn't have to give us this but they did so I love them for this.<br><br>Among the three story: Ancient Love Poetry(ALP), The Last Immortal(TLI) and Moonlight Mystique(MM), as far as ending goes, while they are all a Happy Ending, but MM definitely have the best and most satisfying ending compared to the other 2. I felt like TLI(Yuan Qi and Feng Yin) got the short end of the stick, because at least Bai Jue and Shang Gu(ALP) get to hug, but Yuanqi and Feng Yin(TLI) ending was them standing at a distance looking at each other. <br><br>In the end, it's up to you whether you will watch it or not, but IMO, if you don't watch it then you are really missing out. It may not be every one's cup of tea and that's fine, but I will just say that for me personally, not many Xianxia nowadays pull through as the best and this feeling stay true to the end, since they normally started off well, but then got boring like how I feel towards The Blossoming Love which was airing at the same time, In The Blossoming Love, I got bored with the plot and the direction it was going whereas for Moonlight Mystique, the plot and characters got me engaged/hooked into the story from beginning to the end! <br><br>Oh and let's not forget about the OST! Please be sure to check it out because they are all so good!! I love all of them!!! And I have to say that this is the first time, I never actually want to skip the Opening (Intro song) and Ending (Outro song), because they are very captivating!!!<br><br>P.S: Fan Yue and Bai Shuo is now officially my no.1 favourite Drama CP. I still want to make an honorable mention to my other favourite pairing: Jing Yuan and Xing Yue! To me (if you have not read that thread of mines), then I will just add it here as well: In the overall, how I took the theme to their backstory and ending is, Fan Yue and Bai Shuo are reincarnations to both Jing Yuan and Xing Yue, and they lived on as their happy ending. Just like what Jing Yuan said to Fan Yue before he joins Xing Yue in the stars: that perhaps his awakening(60,000 years later) was to give them(Fan Yue and Bai Shuo) a chance to be together. He told Fan Yue to protect Bai Shuo well and don't let their(Jing Yuan and Xing Yue) regrets in the past repeat itself  so to me, this is how I saw it... To say I am not sad would be a lie, because I was sad in that scene, but when I look at this in another sense/perspective, their ending gives a sense of bittersweet where their happy ending lives on in their next life(as Fan Yue and Bai Shuo) it actually makes sense if you look at reincarnation side of things. I felt like how the writers wrote this was very poetic and sad, yet beautiful at the same time that the love they held for the one they love is irreplaceable. We saw this through Fan Yue, Bai Shuo and Jing Yuan. <br><br>So in the end, does this make me dislike Fan Yue and Bai Shuo for having a happy ending? No!! Because Fan Yue and Bai Shuo deserves their happy ending too and considering all their suffering and sacrifices they earned it and I am glad one way or another Jing Yuan and Xing Yue can live on in Fan Yue and Bai Shuo in that sense(since that is their next life), without Jing Yuan and Xing Yue backstory, then we wouldn't have the Fan Yue and Bai Shuo that we came to love in this lifetime. And I will end my review with one of my favourite quotes in this drama: <br><br>"That's all in the past. This time, we've met again, not as Xing Yue and Jing Yuan, but as Bai Shuo and Fan Yue. In my heart, you're the best Bai Shuo, the only one in this world, and is irreplaceable" - Fan Yue.<br><br>Thank you for this wonderful journey, thank you for making a great start in 2025 for me! MM gave me back the hope that Xianxia can have a happy, satisfying and conclusive ending! I am still reluctant to say goodbye to my beloved characters, so this is currently on my rewatch list!!!<br><br>After several rewatch of this Drama, I decided to check out the Novel, in which I have on my end, and here's my feelings to the Novel in comparison to the Drama: https://mydramalist.com/discussions/738079-zhu-yue/139258-reading-the-novel-made-me-appreciate-love-the-drama-better-contain-spoilers (In summary, after reading the Novel, it made me appreciate/love the Drama even more).  <p class="read-more"><a href="#" class="button">Read More</a></p>  <div class="review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t"> <div class="review-vote review-helpful-423168"><span class="text-muted">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class="btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="423168" data-label="Yes"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="423168" data-label="No"><span>No</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote" data-id="423168"><span>Cancel</span></button>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-gift-award" data-id="423168"></button>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
