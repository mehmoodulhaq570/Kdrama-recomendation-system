We don't have to agree and I'm not here to argue with anyone. This review is kind of lengthy so please bare with me.***General Overview: My Dearest is a profound story set in the year 1636 during the Qing invasion of Joseon. It tells the tale of Gil Chae the \"village\u2019s 99 tale fox\", who can have any man she wants because they are willing to do anything for her at the drop of a hat. The story depicts how this beloved but conceited and naive girl matures as the tides change and she realizes she must be strong for those around her. She has to step up and become a leader and a source of strength in these harsh times. We also meet Jang Hyun, a flawed man whose actions demonstrate how determined he is to change and be better for the woman he loves. He acts as if he doesn't care about much, but as the story progresses, you can see how much he does care and is determined, willing to fight for and help the innocent people around him.The plot revolves around the constraints imposed on various classes of people, gender disparity, camaraderie \u2013 sisterhood and brotherhood all combined with a breathtaking, slow burn romance that continually breaks and mends your heart. It's about survival and, more importantly, perseverance \u2013 it's about how far you're prepared to go for the people you care about. It's a great drama that underlines the importance of sacrifice. This story offers so much more than romance. You get politics, warfare, suspense, drama, heartbreak, romance and everything in between. The story could exist without the love story and I think that\u2019s what makes it so special. The love between the people is what ties everyone together and keeps them hoping for a better and brighter day but it is not the focus of the plot. It is about the perils of war and how that can tear people apart and make them often do things they would have never done in the first place. It\u2019s about choosing the best option not for yourself but for the greater good of everyone. Needless to say I feel like this story has changed the trajectory of my life. Am I embellishing and over exaggerating? Yes, but I\u2019m also being so serious. It\u2019s a story I believe everyone should experience at least once in their life. The artistry and care behind this production is something you can feel through the screen in any scene, at any moment. I won\u2019t say it\u2019s the best Sageuk I\u2019ve ever watched because there is still more to come but for me, it\u2019s pretty damn close. If you're on the fence about watching or starting it, I would highly encourage you to do so. I feel like this drama is a classic and everyone should experience it at least once in their life.____________________________________________________In more detail (spoilers ahead):I genuinely feel like my soul just got ripped out of my body. They literally had me hoping things would work out between Jang Hyun and Gil Chae and in the end they gave us nothing but PAIN?! Let me first take a moment to rewind and go over everything I liked about this drama...They literally gave meet cute, slow burn, enemies to lovers, forbidden love, right person wrong time, drama, suspense, passion and yearning. When I tell you I was on the edge of my seat with each episode. I went into this not knowing whether I would like this drama as much as the next person but I was pleasantly surprised when I realized this would easily become one of my favorite dramas of the year.To say Gil Chae is a well-written, multifaceted character who serves as a role model for women everywhere would be an understatement. She has so many positive attributes, and I found myself being a proud observer of her development.We first meet this young, naive girl who is consumed by the fairytale of having a happy ever after with the man she sees in her dreams (the one she feels is her rightful husband) But oh my how the threads of fate proved to have a different path in store for her. I believe that her dream was foreshadowing all the ups and downs and tribulations she will have to face until she and her lover can finally reunite. We follow Gil Chae on her journey as she transforms from a snobbish, shallow noble's daughter to someone willing to put her life on the line for her friends. The road there is not easy, as we can see but Gil Chae has really blossomed  and transofrmed into something of a force herself since the 1st episode compared to the last. She is truly a flower that changes with the seasons and grows older and wiser as the story progresses.    Jang Hyun, on the other hand, is a laid-back, free-spirited man who clearly puts on a cheerful facade so that people don't see the real him or know his true intentions. He appears to be a man who is uninterested in politics, has no plans to marry, does not believe in supporting / backing his country or the king, and prefers to avoid war and picking sides. In contrast, our Gil Chae fantasizes about her ideal happy marriage with her perfect husband. Jang Hyun claims that love and romance are fleeting and that he does not want to be tied down to anyone as a result. He'd rather think about things and have fun for the time being. That is, until he meets Gil Chae, who changes the course of his life and challenges his previously held beliefs. He appears to be a people-pleaser, always seeking flattery and recognition, but I don't think he knows what he wants at the end of the day. He's a man who has lived a full life, is well read and educated, and has traveled extensively. It'll be interesting to learn more about his backstory.As the story progresses and Jang Hyun's layers are gradually peeled back, you realize he is a shell of a boy, with scars and unhealed trauma from his turbulent past. You can tell he has had a difficult life, but he does not portray himself as a victim; instead, he handles everything with grace. I believe he is very calculating and he sort of quietly observes people as if he sees them as pieces in a game of chess. You notice this when he makes subtle\u00a0remarks about the king and crown prince, or any bad men he encounters. It's heartwarming to see Jang Hyun change for the better as he rises to the occasion and ends up saving countless lives. He wants to live another day and meet Gil Chae again, not because of the war or his circumstances. He perseveres and survives, demonstrating incredible bravery, determination, and resilience in the face of any challenge, battle, or adversary. I love a \"pathetic\" and \"morally gray\" man so much. There's just something so inherently attractive about a man who is down bad for his woman and literally gets so sad at the thought of leaving or losing her \u2013 literally when the mere thought of being apart from her for even a second makes him so lovesick or causes him to make the most unpredictable decisions to protect her. Jang Hyun is the embodiment of \"touch her and I kill you\" and \"I hate everyone in the world but you.\" and that's why he's the best ML to exist. The mere fact that he would probably burn down the world to save Gil Chae is just so satisfying to watch.  I am truly saddened whenever I hear Jang Hyun refer to himself as a terrible man since he is so kind, wise beyond his years and pure of heart. When I tell you we as viewers don't even deserve him, know that I'm being dead serious. Normally, I would find persistence annoying, but the way Jang Hyun pursued Gil Chae had me gasping for air and at a loss for words.  It reminded me of a Bridgerton-esque courtship lol! The tension was so thick and intense that it appeared to be impenetrable even by the sharpest blade.Gil Chae and Jang Hyun share a lot of similarities. They do differ in terms of upbringing, status, and maturity levels, yet throughout the drama, they embark on their own adventures, endure trials, and grow. At first I thought their personalities were too similar and I was unsure about their pairing because in the back of my mind usually it\u2019s opposites that attract.  But as I continued watching I realized they were each others true equals. Nobody else would ever be good enough for either of them. It was clear from their banter and subtle gazes that Jang Hyun understands and knows her, and vice versa. They are, at their core, just two people who long for that one constant love that will never change, regardless of time, space, or distance. No matter how many times Gil Chae hurt his feelings and rejected him, he still hoped that she felt even a smidgeon of affection for him. I melted when he told Yeon Jun that if he could only have a quarter of her heart, he would take it. That is genuine love right there. I loved how Jang Hyun was able to let his guard down for her to truly see he was being sincere in his affection and he never wavered even when Gil Chae was being stubborn / playing hard to get. When faced with adversity, they both are unable to to give up. Both will fight to the death to protect the people they care about, while simultaneously longing for the day when they can reunite. As Jang Hyun said \"I swear by the moonlight, wherever you are, I'll make sure to find you.\" The symbolism of the moon touched me deeply because, just as everyone is under the same moonlight, Gil Chae and Jang Hyun's love will  also remain constant, no matter where they are. This oath/promise is kept throughout the entire drama and solidifies their soulmatism.Namkoong Min and Ahn Eun Jin both delivered outstanding performances. Their portrayal of their characters was so amazing and emotional that it completely blew me away.  Namkoong Min takes us through a variety of thrilling and heartbreaking scenes. His fight scenes are fantastic, as are his tender and  heartfelt scenes demonstrating his growing affection for Gil Chae. Eun Jin does a wonderful job of portraying Gil Chae especially in her funny/silly moments and her painful, heartbreaking ones. Their chemistry is beyond words to the point where it feels palpable through the screen. The side characters and extras also do a phenomenal job of selling their roles. The villains (Qing intruders) are very menacing and they add to the realism of the portrayal.  Everyone in this drama has done a tremendous job acting their asses off \u2013 they are really convincing, and I believe that is what distinguishes this drama. Dislikes:Yeon Jun annoyed me because he seemed to be playing with Gil Chae's emotions. He seemed harsh when he said that Gil Chae could have any man she wanted, but Eun Ae could only have him. Which was true, but it was still brutal, made worse by the fact that he almost broke down his wall, revealed his true feelings, and kissed her. My heart broke for Gil Chae, but it was exactly what she needed to mature. She needed to experience the fantasy and dream of one-sided love. Something that appeared to be perfectly crafted in her head, but was actually something entirely different in reality. I was relieved she chose to be selfless and encouraged Eun Ae to marry him instead. It was touching how she stood by her friend and assured her that she was worthy of being his wife and the best person for him. He still irritated me in the end because when it was time for him to step up, he didn't and made the lame excuse of not wanting to betray his country and maintain his pride, but all the characters literally suffered and were affected as a result of that one decision. He caused his wife and her friends/family to suffer as a result of his pride and stupidity, which is completely different from Jang Hyun in that regard because at least he is able to use his morals/judgment and be selfless even in difficult situations.Let us now discuss Ryang Eum. He clearly idolizes Jang Hyun to the point where he believes he has developed strong, intense feelings for him. Jang Hyun saved Ryang Eum from a bad man who was torturing him when he was a boy, and his gratitude grew into adoration and love. While I don't blame him for feeling the way he does, the way he goes about being a driving force to keep Gil Chae and Jang Hyun apart is deceitful and dishonest. I'm not sure how he can face Gil Chae or Jang Hyun after literally betraying them both. Isn't he aware that he is the problem and the plot device / boulder in the way of their love? I'm sure he's smart enough to realize Jang Hyun will never feel the same way he does, will never return his affections, and yet he's hellbent on sabotaging them and then making pathetic excuses like \"I thought she'd make you miserable\"? I needed him to be so for real! He irritated me, but what is a drama without close friends betraying characters' trust and undercover foes driving the plot?I also dislike the officer (Won Moo). At first, I was overjoyed at his kindness towards Gil Chae but disappointed when I realized he wanted more than friendship, that he wanted to marry her and offer her a more comfortable life. I guess the deciding factor for Gil Chae was when Won Moo said he would still have her  knowing she had another man in her heart. That should have made me feel relieved but I was just so torn as all of this transpired while she thought Jang Hyun was dead. I was celebrating when I believed Gil Chae was going to go with Jang Hyun and the officer would have turned a blind eye and let her, but that did not happen because Won Moo chose to be cruel and let her mentally ill father loose in an attempt to bring her back home. While I wholeheartedly understand Gil Chae's motives, her duty to stay and take care of her family, as she is the sole provider for them, it didn't make the ending of the third act conflict any less painful. Jang Hyun and Gil Chae have been through so much that they deserve to be happy, with each other. I don't know what else to say other than I hope the officer dies. Just anything else just so Gil Chae can be with the man she truly loves. But of course, things are never that simple and we don't get what we want because life isn't fair and it seems like the ML and FL must always be facing obstacles that push them further apart. Final Thoughts:Overall, the drama's historical accuracy is astounding. The costumes, scenery, and realistic depictions of the brutality of war is one of the best I've seen in a historical drama. The OST they used is simply stunning and heartfelt. The songs complement the story perfectly and leave an emptiness / yearning that just stays with you. Each episode held my attention, and I'm not going to lie, I've shed a few tears. So be sure to bring your box of tissues lol! My biggest fear is that this drama will end in tragedy. I really hope not. but even if it does I know that i'll stick around until the final episodes' credits roll.I thoroughly enjoyed this and I\u2019m still reeling from this immense high. They gave cinema. They gave near perfection. It\u2019s just that the ending pissed me off so much I wanted to rate it lower but I will stick to my initial thought. I am still waiting for things to get better They literally had me for more than half of the episodes and then completely shattered me with that ending. While I am aware it is a continuation to say I was disappointed / dissatisfied with the cliffhanger of an ending, is an understatement. I can empathize with Gil Chae and her motives behind choosing to stay for her father and her friends but it hurts to know that two people are so perfect for each other but can't be together (yet). They keep missing their timing, which is both frustrating and exciting. Obviously, if you start this drama expect a simple and sweet love story, you should reconsider. This is not a drama for the faint of heart. Is it perfect? Yes and no. It's complicated, but that's kind of the point, and it's one of the reasons I enjoy this drama so much. I love how intricate the storylines and characters are. I like that this drama strikes a balance between highlighting the struggle of doing what is right versus doing what is necessary, delving into how far people are willing to go to survive and protect those they care about. This story was written for angst , slow burn, acts of service and pain / comfort lovers like me. In my opinion, these tropes have never hit harder, and I can't wait to see everything else that unravels in the future with these complex characters.Sidenote:(I am mad at myself for not watching it sooner but I was unable to start it knowing Part 2 would not be released until October. I started it last night October 12, 2023 and completed it this morning October 13, 2023. I am so excited for Part 2 but also worried because it might be a very sad ending)I'm expecting more trials and tribulations, but I'm not too concerned because Gil Chae is a resilient person who I believe can and will face anything with a brave heart. Jang Hyun is also a very resourceful and determined man as well, so I doubt this is the end of their story.The underlying message of this drama is that relationships require effort and that love is a choice people make every day rather than just a fleeting emotion. It demonstrates how two flawed people fight for each other without losing their sense of self-worth. This drama isn't about your typical delicate and frail damsel in distress waiting for a knight in shining armor to come and save her... instead, it's about how two people strive to be together despite all odds but trust that in the end they will  have the courage and endurance to take care of themselves until they meet again.With ALL of that being said, I gave it a smashing 9.5/10 and I can\u2019t wait to see what\u2019s next!Thank you to everyone who actually took the time to read my review! \u2764\ufe0f\ud81a\udd23.\ud81a\udd67.\ud81a\udc7c.\u2698","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9.5}}}</script>

Yoo Gil Chae is a pretty, bubbly, and a bit spoiled young lady who's called the 99 tailed fox of Neunggun-ri. She is also a bit of an outcast because other young ladies are jealous of her. They seem to think she's too straightforward and her behavior is inappropriate<span class="read-more-hidden"> for a young lady, while young noblemen think highly of her. Gil Chae knows how to get men to fall for her but fails to capture the heart of the person she likes.

Lee Jang Hyeon is a mysterious man who suddenly appears in the Neunggun-ri social scene. Nobody really knows anything about him. Young nobles don't like him, but the elderly are wrapped around his finger. He's been dating around a lot, but he becomes curious about a certain 99 tailed fox, and one day, the said fox quite literally crash lands into his arms.

Once war is brewing, the pair finds themselves separated before they could even start to make sense of their feelings.

We don't have to agree and I'm not here to argue with anyone. This review is kind of lengthy so please bare with me.***<br><br>General Overview: <br><br>My Dearest is a profound story set in the year 1636 during the Qing invasion of Joseon. It tells the tale of Gil Chae the "village’s 99 tale fox", who can have any man she wants because they are willing to do anything for her at the drop of a hat. The story depicts how this beloved but conceited and naive girl matures as the tides change and she realizes she must be strong for those around her. She has to step up and become a leader and a source of strength in these harsh times. We also meet Jang Hyun, a flawed man whose actions demonstrate how determined he is to change and be better for the woman he loves. He acts as if he doesn't care about much, but as the story progresses, you can see how much he does care and is determined, willing to fight for and help the innocent people around him.<br><br>The plot revolves around the constraints imposed on various classes of people, gender disparity, camaraderie – sisterhood and brotherhood all combined with a breathtaking, slow burn romance that continually breaks and mends your heart. It's about survival and, more importantly, perseverance – it's about how far you're prepared to go for the people you care about. It's a great drama that underlines the importance of sacrifice. This story offers so much more than romance. You get politics, warfare, suspense, drama, heartbreak, romance and everything in between. The story could exist without the love story and I think that’s what makes it so special. The love between the people is what ties everyone together and keeps them hoping for a better and brighter day but it is not the focus of the plot. It is about the perils of war and how that can tear people apart and make them often do things they would have never done in the first place. It’s about choosing the best option not for yourself but for the greater good of everyone. <br><br>Needless to say I feel like this story has changed the trajectory of my life. Am I embellishing and over exaggerating? Yes, but I’m also being so serious. It’s a story I believe everyone should experience at least once in their life. The artistry and care behind this production is something you can feel through the screen in any scene, at any moment. I won’t say it’s the best Sageuk I’ve ever watched because there is still more to come but for me, it’s pretty damn close. <br><br>If you're on the fence about watching or starting it, I would highly encourage you to do so. I feel like this drama is a classic and everyone should experience it at least once in their life.<br><br>____________________________________________________<br><br>In more detail (spoilers ahead):<br><br>I genuinely feel like my soul just got ripped out of my body. They literally had me hoping things would work out between Jang Hyun and Gil Chae and in the end they gave us nothing but PAIN?! <br><br>Let me first take a moment to rewind and go over everything I liked about this drama...<br><br>They literally gave meet cute, slow burn, enemies to lovers, forbidden love, right person wrong time, drama, suspense, passion and yearning. When I tell you I was on the edge of my seat with each episode. I went into this not knowing whether I would like this drama as much as the next person but I was pleasantly surprised when I realized this would easily become one of my favorite dramas of the year.<br><br>To say Gil Chae is a well-written, multifaceted character who serves as a role model for women everywhere would be an understatement. She has so many positive attributes, and I found myself being a proud observer of her development.<br><br>We first meet this young, naive girl who is consumed by the fairytale of having a happy ever after with the man she sees in her dreams (the one she feels is her rightful husband) But oh my how the threads of fate proved to have a different path in store for her. I believe that her dream was foreshadowing all the ups and downs and tribulations she will have to face until she and her lover can finally reunite. We follow Gil Chae on her journey as she transforms from a snobbish, shallow noble's daughter to someone willing to put her life on the line for her friends. The road there is not easy, as we can see but Gil Chae has really blossomed  and transofrmed into something of a force herself since the 1st episode compared to the last. She is truly a flower that changes with the seasons and grows older and wiser as the story progresses.  <br>  <br>Jang Hyun, on the other hand, is a laid-back, free-spirited man who clearly puts on a cheerful facade so that people don't see the real him or know his true intentions. He appears to be a man who is uninterested in politics, has no plans to marry, does not believe in supporting / backing his country or the king, and prefers to avoid war and picking sides. In contrast, our Gil Chae fantasizes about her ideal happy marriage with her perfect husband. Jang Hyun claims that love and romance are fleeting and that he does not want to be tied down to anyone as a result. He'd rather think about things and have fun for the time being. That is, until he meets Gil Chae, who changes the course of his life and challenges his previously held beliefs. He appears to be a people-pleaser, always seeking flattery and recognition, but I don't think he knows what he wants at the end of the day. He's a man who has lived a full life, is well read and educated, and has traveled extensively. It'll be interesting to learn more about his backstory.<br><br>As the story progresses and Jang Hyun's layers are gradually peeled back, you realize he is a shell of a boy, with scars and unhealed trauma from his turbulent past. You can tell he has had a difficult life, but he does not portray himself as a victim; instead, he handles everything with grace. I believe he is very calculating and he sort of quietly observes people as if he sees them as pieces in a game of chess. You notice this when he makes subtle&nbsp;remarks about the king and crown prince, or any bad men he encounters. It's heartwarming to see Jang Hyun change for the better as he rises to the occasion and ends up saving countless lives. He wants to live another day and meet Gil Chae again, not because of the war or his circumstances. He perseveres and survives, demonstrating incredible bravery, determination, and resilience in the face of any challenge, battle, or adversary. <br><br>I love a "pathetic" and "morally gray" man so much. There's just something so inherently attractive about a man who is down bad for his woman and literally gets so sad at the thought of leaving or losing her – literally when the mere thought of being apart from her for even a second makes him so lovesick or causes him to make the most unpredictable decisions to protect her. Jang Hyun is the embodiment of "touch her and I kill you" and "I hate everyone in the world but you." and that's why he's the best ML to exist. The mere fact that he would probably burn down the world to save Gil Chae is just so satisfying to watch.  I am truly saddened whenever I hear Jang Hyun refer to himself as a terrible man since he is so kind, wise beyond his years and pure of heart. When I tell you we as viewers don't even deserve him, know that I'm being dead serious. Normally, I would find persistence annoying, but the way Jang Hyun pursued Gil Chae had me gasping for air and at a loss for words.  It reminded me of a Bridgerton-esque courtship lol! The tension was so thick and intense that it appeared to be impenetrable even by the sharpest blade.<br><br>Gil Chae and Jang Hyun share a lot of similarities. They do differ in terms of upbringing, status, and maturity levels, yet throughout the drama, they embark on their own adventures, endure trials, and grow. At first I thought their personalities were too similar and I was unsure about their pairing because in the back of my mind usually it’s opposites that attract.  But as I continued watching I realized they were each others true equals. Nobody else would ever be good enough for either of them. It was clear from their banter and subtle gazes that Jang Hyun understands and knows her, and vice versa. They are, at their core, just two people who long for that one constant love that will never change, regardless of time, space, or distance. No matter how many times Gil Chae hurt his feelings and rejected him, he still hoped that she felt even a smidgeon of affection for him. I melted when he told Yeon Jun that if he could only have a quarter of her heart, he would take it. That is genuine love right there. I loved how Jang Hyun was able to let his guard down for her to truly see he was being sincere in his affection and he never wavered even when Gil Chae was being stubborn / playing hard to get. When faced with adversity, they both are unable to to give up. Both will fight to the death to protect the people they care about, while simultaneously longing for the day when they can reunite. <br><br>As Jang Hyun said "I swear by the moonlight, wherever you are, I'll make sure to find you." The symbolism of the moon touched me deeply because, just as everyone is under the same moonlight, Gil Chae and Jang Hyun's love will  also remain constant, no matter where they are. This oath/promise is kept throughout the entire drama and solidifies their soulmatism.<br><br>Namkoong Min and Ahn Eun Jin both delivered outstanding performances. Their portrayal of their characters was so amazing and emotional that it completely blew me away.  Namkoong Min takes us through a variety of thrilling and heartbreaking scenes. His fight scenes are fantastic, as are his tender and  heartfelt scenes demonstrating his growing affection for Gil Chae. Eun Jin does a wonderful job of portraying Gil Chae especially in her funny/silly moments and her painful, heartbreaking ones. Their chemistry is beyond words to the point where it feels palpable through the screen. The side characters and extras also do a phenomenal job of selling their roles. The villains (Qing intruders) are very menacing and they add to the realism of the portrayal.  Everyone in this drama has done a tremendous job acting their asses off – they are really convincing, and I believe that is what distinguishes this drama. <br><br><br>Dislikes:<br><br>Yeon Jun annoyed me because he seemed to be playing with Gil Chae's emotions. He seemed harsh when he said that Gil Chae could have any man she wanted, but Eun Ae could only have him. Which was true, but it was still brutal, made worse by the fact that he almost broke down his wall, revealed his true feelings, and kissed her. My heart broke for Gil Chae, but it was exactly what she needed to mature. She needed to experience the fantasy and dream of one-sided love. Something that appeared to be perfectly crafted in her head, but was actually something entirely different in reality. I was relieved she chose to be selfless and encouraged Eun Ae to marry him instead. It was touching how she stood by her friend and assured her that she was worthy of being his wife and the best person for him. He still irritated me in the end because when it was time for him to step up, he didn't and made the lame excuse of not wanting to betray his country and maintain his pride, but all the characters literally suffered and were affected as a result of that one decision. He caused his wife and her friends/family to suffer as a result of his pride and stupidity, which is completely different from Jang Hyun in that regard because at least he is able to use his morals/judgment and be selfless even in difficult situations.<br><br>Let us now discuss Ryang Eum. He clearly idolizes Jang Hyun to the point where he believes he has developed strong, intense feelings for him. Jang Hyun saved Ryang Eum from a bad man who was torturing him when he was a boy, and his gratitude grew into adoration and love. While I don't blame him for feeling the way he does, the way he goes about being a driving force to keep Gil Chae and Jang Hyun apart is deceitful and dishonest. I'm not sure how he can face Gil Chae or Jang Hyun after literally betraying them both. Isn't he aware that he is the problem and the plot device / boulder in the way of their love? I'm sure he's smart enough to realize Jang Hyun will never feel the same way he does, will never return his affections, and yet he's hellbent on sabotaging them and then making pathetic excuses like "I thought she'd make you miserable"? I needed him to be so for real! He irritated me, but what is a drama without close friends betraying characters' trust and undercover foes driving the plot?<br><br>I also dislike the officer (Won Moo). At first, I was overjoyed at his kindness towards Gil Chae but disappointed when I realized he wanted more than friendship, that he wanted to marry her and offer her a more comfortable life. I guess the deciding factor for Gil Chae was when Won Moo said he would still have her  knowing she had another man in her heart. That should have made me feel relieved but I was just so torn as all of this transpired while she thought Jang Hyun was dead. I was celebrating when I believed Gil Chae was going to go with Jang Hyun and the officer would have turned a blind eye and let her, but that did not happen because Won Moo chose to be cruel and let her mentally ill father loose in an attempt to bring her back home. While I wholeheartedly understand Gil Chae's motives, her duty to stay and take care of her family, as she is the sole provider for them, it didn't make the ending of the third act conflict any less painful. Jang Hyun and Gil Chae have been through so much that they deserve to be happy, with each other. I don't know what else to say other than I hope the officer dies. Just anything else just so Gil Chae can be with the man she truly loves. But of course, things are never that simple and we don't get what we want because life isn't fair and it seems like the ML and FL must always be facing obstacles that push them further apart. <br><br><br>Final Thoughts:<br><br>Overall, the drama's historical accuracy is astounding. The costumes, scenery, and realistic depictions of the brutality of war is one of the best I've seen in a historical drama. The OST they used is simply stunning and heartfelt. The songs complement the story perfectly and leave an emptiness / yearning that just stays with you. Each episode held my attention, and I'm not going to lie, I've shed a few tears. So be sure to bring your box of tissues lol! My biggest fear is that this drama will end in tragedy. I really hope not. but even if it does I know that i'll stick around until the final episodes' credits roll.<br><br>I thoroughly enjoyed this and I’m still reeling from this immense high. They gave cinema. They gave near perfection. It’s just that the ending pissed me off so much I wanted to rate it lower but I will stick to my initial thought. I am still waiting for things to get better They literally had me for more than half of the episodes and then completely shattered me with that ending. While I am aware it is a continuation to say I was disappointed / dissatisfied with the cliffhanger of an ending, is an understatement. I can empathize with Gil Chae and her motives behind choosing to stay for her father and her friends but it hurts to know that two people are so perfect for each other but can't be together (yet). They keep missing their timing, which is both frustrating and exciting. <br><br>Obviously, if you start this drama expect a simple and sweet love story, you should reconsider. This is not a drama for the faint of heart. Is it perfect? Yes and no. It's complicated, but that's kind of the point, and it's one of the reasons I enjoy this drama so much. I love how intricate the storylines and characters are. I like that this drama strikes a balance between highlighting the struggle of doing what is right versus doing what is necessary, delving into how far people are willing to go to survive and protect those they care about. This story was written for angst , slow burn, acts of service and pain / comfort lovers like me. In my opinion, these tropes have never hit harder, and I can't wait to see everything else that unravels in the future with these complex characters.<br><br><br>Sidenote:<br><br>(I am mad at myself for not watching it sooner but I was unable to start it knowing Part 2 would not be released until October. I started it last night October 12, 2023 and completed it this morning October 13, 2023. I am so excited for Part 2 but also worried because it might be a very sad ending)<br><br>I'm expecting more trials and tribulations, but I'm not too concerned because Gil Chae is a resilient person who I believe can and will face anything with a brave heart. Jang Hyun is also a very resourceful and determined man as well, so I doubt this is the end of their story.<br><br>The underlying message of this drama is that relationships require effort and that love is a choice people make every day rather than just a fleeting emotion. It demonstrates how two flawed people fight for each other without losing their sense of self-worth. This drama isn't about your typical delicate and frail damsel in distress waiting for a knight in shining armor to come and save her... instead, it's about how two people strive to be together despite all odds but trust that in the end they will  have the courage and endurance to take care of themselves until they meet again.<br><br>With ALL of that being said, I gave it a smashing 9.5/10 and I can’t wait to see what’s next!<br><br><br>Thank you to everyone who actually took the time to read my review! ❤️<br><br><br>𖤣.𖥧.𖡼.⚘<br><br>  <p class="read-more"><a href="#" class="button">Read More</a></p>  <div class="review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t"> <div class="review-vote review-helpful-309555"><span class="text-muted">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class="btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="309555" data-label="Yes"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="309555" data-label="No"><span>No</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote" data-id="309555"><span>Cancel</span></button>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-gift-award" data-id="309555"></button>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>

Historical epic. Visually stunning. Magnificent. What starts out harmless is caught up in the merciless story. Please buckle up. "My Dearest" goes all out. Thrilling! Moving! Intoxicating.<br><br>The excursion leads into a painful chapter of Joseon's past, its historical cornerstones being emotionally successfully captured in striking scenes. Already after the third episode one may have forgotten the harmlessly rocking swings... back when everything was right with the world. On the other hand, the worst at times brings out the best in people. This may certainly be true for our protagonists, because the more hopeless the circumstances, the more persistent their personal commitment.<br><br>A dramatic story. A moving love story. An excellent historical drama. Definitely worth seeing. The time around the Qing invasion on the Joseon Peninsula will remain unforgettable for everyone... and the epic relationship of our protagonists too!<br>What a couple - in the course of their encounters, Namgoong Min and Ahn Eun-jin develop a strong, charismatic attraction for their ambivalent and baffling, yet complex and nuanced characters. All this is visually perfectly staged. Perfection applies overall to the dramaturgical layout of the intertwined personal and political processes. "My Dearest" offers differentiated, touching character portraits right down to the supporting roles. Powerful!<br><br> Unfortunately, after the tenth episode, we're stuck for a while before we continue with the second season... But until then, as far as I am concerned, "My Dearest" has been a complete success! <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br>-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br><br>SIDE NOTE --- the Qing invasion 1636 ---<br>The historical context of “My Dearest” is quite an issue for Joseon history! For the Korean national self-image the impact of the Qing invasion of 1636 can be reckoned even more traumatic, shameful and dramatic than the unparalleled Japanese invasions of the Imjin Wars in 1592 and 1598. This is because Joseon finally had to ignominiously submit to the Qing and eventually remained their vassal state until the First Sino-Japanese War end of the 19th century. (With Imjin Wars, Joseon was actually able to repel their invaders - at that time with the help of the Ming - and thus could preserve the grandeur of sovereignty.) That second Qing invasion in 1636 went down in history as a truly disastrous defeat. Who likes to remember such a 'weak' king and such unspeakably embarrassing humiliation?<br><br>Apart from its touching epic love story, "My Dearest" thus also deals with the narrative of the people of Joseon back in the 17th century - their different positions, either pragmatic or idealistic. That time of the invasion is well documented in diaries of contemporary witnesses. Historical scholars to date, however, have discussed the Qing invasions in Joseon mostly from the perspective of the Qing against the Ming and the political power struggles concerning the Chinese empire. In “My Dearest” the Joseon perspective is given its own emotional narrative. And this is characterized by personalities, ideals, value systems, symbolic gestures, as well as those small and large deeds and sacrifices of inconspicuous people who often fall through the cracks of historiography. So "My Dearest" isn't just heartfelt entertainment. To a certain extent, the KDrama has an identity-forming, great mission and takes it very seriously and right into mass consciousness. Its intention is to be suitably great. It offers portraits of the people at that time an how they were processing historically questionable/questioned decisions, too. It brings us close to the dilemma of that time. And greatly so.<br><br>-------------------------------------------------------------------------  <p class="read-more"><a href="#" class="button">Read More</a></p>  <div class="review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t"> <div class="review-vote review-helpful-300933"><span class="text-muted">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class="btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="300933" data-label="Yes"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="300933" data-label="No"><span>No</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote" data-id="300933"><span>Cancel</span></button>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-gift-award" data-id="300933"></button>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
