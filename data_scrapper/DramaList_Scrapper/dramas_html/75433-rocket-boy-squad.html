It will make you witness, observe and analyse different forms of relationships, various shapes of love, many aspects of life and immense depths of life values. I am not lying, it reminded me of my REPLY SERIES days because of similar screenplay technique used in it.Another peculiar fact about this drama that's clearly visible is that unlike it's name suggests, it's not entirely, or even majorly about Badminton, even though all the main characters are involved in this sports. It's just like Hospital Playlist which despite it's name, mainly deals with day-to-day happenings of the hospital and not just surgeries, diseases, management, etc. So, We call these \"slice of life\" kdramas for a reason and undoubtedly it's the best genre among others. STORY & PLOT:Racket Boys following a similar path of Hospital Playlist, involves badminton players, coaches, association, schools, teams, etc. and their daily lives, evens & odds, results or outcomes and aspirations. The main plot is about a group of 5 teen boys namely \"Racket Sonyeondan (Racket Boys) who are high school badminton players of Haenam-gun Middle High of South Jeolla Province and their journey towards winning a national level competition, together as a team. It starts with Yoon Hae Kang (Tang Joon Sang) moving to Haenam county village from Seoul after his father's financial breakdown. As someone with parents who are both badminton coaches, he was initially an amazing badminton champ but switched to baseball for reasons. However, as he moves down to the underdeveloped village and joins the badminton team just to help them once, he finds himself realizing how much he loved the sports from his childhood and then embraces it with grace.The story also involves 2 teenage girls who stay with these 5 boys under one roof with Hae Kang's parents and little sister. Together they persue the sports they love so much, explore life & relationships, help each other to improve as players and seek happiness in staying together. The story at some points also throws light upon the past of some characters. Again, the story involves few villagers who are the neighbours of these badminton fellows staying under the orange roof. All these people help each other during odds as well as celebrate their evens together, which actually portrays the life of a typical village or country side region, irrespective of counties. This was a very good side of the drama to witness and a perfect concept of slice of life stories, I feel. The story additionally involves badminton players from different schools, regions and countries, plenty of coaches & association members, shop, store, restro, motel owners, saffs, etc etc.Since it's a coming of age story, you'll literally go through an emotional rollercoaster which involves both happy & sad moments that will make you cry outta despair or sometimes the tears of joy. One moment you'll be smiling wide and the next moment you'll be laughing the hell out of you and other times you'll be crying out of nostalgia.CAST & ACTING: I feel Racket Boys could have got much more recognition than this in its real time airing if most of the Kdrama audience were not always focused on the starcast of a drama. I know a lot of people are watching it but still it deserves more. The story is of teenagers and the production did a very good job in casting them. Unlike many highscool Kdrama where actors in their middle or late 20s are casted for 18-20 yo characters, Racket Boys casted actual teenagers, hence bringing change in the norms. Also, the writer of this drama was also the writer of Prison Playbook, so you'll see many characters from that drama here and also many guest appearances.There is definite character development for each and every single character in this drama, irrespective of their roles, from oldies to youngs. Let me describe the main characters, which is a bit lengthy because I don't really write a lot about this part but the growth of characters in this drama is actually something to be noted and learnt.The main lead Yoon Hae Kang (Tang Joon Sang) is actually a very good Korean-Malyasian teen actor who rose to fame even though he has few dramas, after his role in CLOY. Loved him playing an asperger kid in \"Move to Heaven\" and \"Racket Boys\" hopefully brings him the recognition he deserves for his skills. His character always aspired to win and was pretty conceited, also a lil narcissist. His expressions and way of delivery were so on point and he needs to be praised for that.Kim Kang Hoon, almost everyone's favourite child actor has always mesmerized us with his acting and in this drama he got a cute character who is always emotional, yet clueless. His countryside accent is so cute and I totally loved him as Lee Young Tae.Bang Yoon Dam (Song Sang Yeon) is so handsome *blushes under the blanket*. I thought he'll have a somewhat cool character but he's someone who is selfie & sns addict who ends up taking selfies with everyone he meets. He is very easy-peasy.Choi Hyun Wook is cute and his character Na Woo Chan with a father who is a military personnel had to struggle a lot about choosing a path that made him happy yet question on his capabilities. The way he kept going and got motivated every time from others, is really well shown.Lee Jae In as Han Se Yeon is the most talented badminton player in the world who rarely loses a match, is always calm and relax while playing a match. She loves her team and her coach but isn't open to everyone. She knows how to work under pressure at any given condition.Lee Ji Won (Lee Han Sol) and Kim Min Ki (Jung In Sol) did very good job. Han Sol is a straightforward girl and Se Yeon's best friend who gives her best and improves with time. In Sol, the so called Nerd who ranks 1st in the province and the son of a councilman joins the team for his love for badminton and his craving to make friends and hangout with them. The child actor who played Yoon Hae In (Hae Kang's little sister) was cute and her character is mature for her age, which she actually played well.Kim Sang Kyung as coach Yoon Hyun Jung played a good character who is aware of his own weaknesses and incompetency and always tried his best to improve himself just so he can help his students better. He was super funny, supportive, loving coach, father, husband and colleague that everyone loved him. Oh Na Ra as coach Ra Young Ja was fierce who never compromised with her teaching methods and her students' well being. She always fought for a fairer environment for the players. Head Coach Bae/White Wolf was such an inspiring character who despite of his strict & disciplined nature strived to provide everything to everyone whom he's responsible for. I loved him.If I go further I might end up talking about all of them because there were a LOT of familiar and old (as in by age) faces in this drama whom I have loved, respected and cherished for a long a time. I was so happy to see all of them in this single drama. Also so many guest appearances from the Prison Playbook cast plus others; such a delightful journey it was to witness.DIRECTION & WRITING:This drama given its genre, setup and vibes has been able to achieve a great direction from Jo Young Kwang pd-nim who has a good history of directing beautiful dramas before. The editing is just like as it should have been for a slice of life drama. Synchronisation, organization, connection, intertwining, linking and presentation, everything is good. Even sound editing in different situations, i.e. funny, emotional, inspirational, romantic, energetic, etc, has been perfectly done; just like it should have been for a light heart comedy and feel good drama. The cinematography is top notch. In sports shows, it's necessary to take care about the angles of videography and showcase the movements & techniques of the players perfectly and this drama has been able to do it very well.Jung Bo Hoon jakkanim is a disciple of the legendary writer Lee Woo Jung jakkanim who has created masterpiece dramas all her life and have worked together in \"Prison Playbook\". Undoubtedly, Bo Hoon jakkanim just like \"Prison Playbook\" has again delivered a masterpiece drama \"Racket Boys\". The screenwriting, dialogues, line coordination, scene organization and everything has been very well done by him and hence he needs appreciation. Also, he needs to work and create more and I'm sure he'll do better.When I said that this drama reminded me of the REPLY SERIES, especially \"Reply 1988\" , I honesty meant it. OSTs:I suppose there are 5 OSTs in total along with the number of featured old & modern songs that the characters in the drama listen. Just like the title, the drama has some references of Bangtan Sonyeondan (BTS) and there songs, hence following the trend. Tbh, the OSTs are not that extraordinary here but I feel they're appropriately fit for the kind of vibes this drama gives off. In fact, it's okay for a slice of life drama to have less OSTs because the number of scenes are really high and they won't want to use OSTs a lot in the story, otherwise it'd be lengthy. So, they put them as background scores during conversations.I love \"Will Be\" by The Boyz the most which is clearly the main theme OST for the drama used as a mean of power source, inspiration, motivation and pushes you forward. \"Focus on Me\" by Coffeeboy is a light romantic track mostly used for the subtle romance between the teen lead couple. \"I Love You Teacher\" , \"Cloud\" and \"To Find Myself\" are good too. DESCRIPTION:I think I have described how I feel about this drama enough but I feel I have either run out of words or got lot more to say. This drama truly belongs to that category of Korean shows which you should watch whenever you feel down or in a mood of watching a beautiful and feel good thing. The screenplay is in a mixed manner where one particular scene doesn't run constantly and rather another event that's going on simultaneously is showed in between; that's the technique for a slice of life drama. Majority of the things which seemed to be something turned out be another. Comedy scenes are accompanied by emotional turnovers in the end or vice versa. There were things that taught us stuffs about life, sports, teaching, parenting, social life, etc. Since the drama focuses on badminton it honestly reminded me of the old days when I played the sports. In fact, it is the only outdoor sports I can play well though I don't get to play often these days. It revived the love I have had for this game. It also throws light on the reputation of badminton among the major sports, people's thoughts about it and the youths'  interest in it. The life of badminton athletes, their struggle to keep going among lots of other competitors or peers, the perspective of the coaches, the happenings inside the association and the environment of badminton courts as well as school/province/national level competitions, etc have been very well portrayed in the drama. The way they have shown all the competitions, the games in it and the sets played by the athelets, is very good, though not entirely shown. I think that's fine since it's a drama and they had a lot to show, even things other than the sports. An athlete's way of handling pressure, tackling the opponent, coping to the changing environment, even sometimes giving in as well as giving up, all these also included which are essential parts of their life and the sports.I love how the village/country-side things like the lifestyle, the environment, the socio-cultural behaviour, the developing relationships, the agri-farm businesses, etc have been picturized in this drama. They sometimes hesitated to make acquaintances and were holding each other tight the next moment. They fought with each other several times and ended up crying tears of joy/pain together some other time. The love and support of the villagers for the Racket Boys was enormous. The old lady's affection for kids was so overwhelming to see; she enjoyed having more kids under her roof, always fed them with their favorite delicacies and even protected them some times. The progressing life of Seoul couple who moved to the village because of situations, has also been beautifully written. The way they grew fond of the village and it's people was even more heart-touching. The things between the association like the bonding between the coaches, the coaches' urge to do better for their students, the management as well as selection procedures in the sport plus the corrupt and unfair doings of handful number of bad people has been shown. The way everything was handled, corrected and planned was very good.Lastly, the portrayal of different relationship between the cast, such as, parents-children, elderly & middle-aged couples/partner/spouses, brother-sister, coach-athelete, teacher-student, friends, opponents, etc. made this drama very beautiful, I truly love the way they've been shown. The subtle romance between Yoon Hae Kang and Se Yeon was very cute. They would have shown more of it if they were a lil older but I feel it's totally okay since the drama doesn't focuses or in fact requires romance. The 2nd couple in the drama were cute as well (not spoiling).  About the controversy, it's again incorrectly misinterpreted. How is it racist to tell that the audience discourage the opponent athlete and the country provides unsuitable environment to the guest athletes? I understand it sometimes feels offensive but that's how sports and army dramas/movies work. Every country does that while producing things about their own athlete. I too was angry at such gestures of my own country doing the same in every sports movie until I came to realize this is one of the dramatic elements in a movie/series meant for entertainment and it's not throwing mud to the other country. They don't complain or criticise because they also think the same and are sane enough to differentiate what's racism . Firstly, this isn't what you call racism and finally, this isn't demeaning at all to the mentioned country. I am sure no one would have cared if they had mentioned a country from the West or even another country from the East.The ending was good. The last 2 episodes were all about the main national level competition that the boys and even the girls had been waiting for. The games have lengthier duration and before or between the each game, they have shown, how the athletes were motivated, guided or instructed by many people. I loved the ending. Won't say more or it'd serve as spoiler.CONCLUSION:The drama was an absolute treat to my eyes, to my heart and to my mental health that gave me the wholesome nostalgic feelings throughout and made me want more of it. I am sad that it has ended. I started it 3 weeks back, 2 days before it was supposed to end but I was honestly very sad and angry when they kept delaying for 2 consecutive weeks. It felt like ages waiting for the finale and it has actually delivered all my expectations and anticipations that I have had for the last 2 weeks; I am glad for that. Honestly, at some points of the drama the screenplay felt a lil slow and some other points the plot felt moderately blunt but thankfully it caught it's original momentum back in the next instance, every time. There are definitely few flaws in other technical aspects as well but anyways RACKET BOYS, overally, is a very good drama which is binge worthy and will make your day better any time you wanna watch it. The rewatch value is very high, i.e. you can watch it again and again, that too it can be placed under random play dramas that you can start from any point and can easily get into. Go ahead and watch it ASAP.DEFINITELY COMING BACK TO THIS.","reviewRating":{"@type":"Rating","worstRating":1,"bestRating":10,"ratingValue":9}}}</script>

ALERT<br>Racket Boys is a coming of age, slice of life, feel good, sports comedy drama which along with the sports of badminton also shows you different shades of life. It will make you witness, observe and analyse different forms of relationships, various shapes of love, many aspects of life and immense depths of life values. I am not lying, it reminded me of my REPLY SERIES days because of similar screenplay technique used in it.<br><br>Another peculiar fact about this drama that's clearly visible is that unlike it's name suggests, it's not entirely, or even majorly about Badminton, even though all the main characters are involved in this sports. It's just like Hospital Playlist which despite it's name, mainly deals with day-to-day happenings of the hospital and not just surgeries, diseases, management, etc. So, We call these "slice of life" kdramas for a reason and undoubtedly it's the best genre among others. <br><br>STORY &amp; PLOT:<br>Racket Boys following a similar path of Hospital Playlist, involves badminton players, coaches, association, schools, teams, etc. and their daily lives, evens &amp; odds, results or outcomes and aspirations. <br><br>The main plot is about a group of 5 teen boys namely "Racket Sonyeondan (Racket Boys) who are high school badminton players of Haenam-gun Middle High of South Jeolla Province and their journey towards winning a national level competition, together as a team. It starts with Yoon Hae Kang (Tang Joon Sang) moving to Haenam county village from Seoul after his father's financial breakdown. As someone with parents who are both badminton coaches, he was initially an amazing badminton champ but switched to baseball for reasons. However, as he moves down to the underdeveloped village and joins the badminton team just to help them once, he finds himself realizing how much he loved the sports from his childhood and then embraces it with grace.<br><br>The story also involves 2 teenage girls who stay with these 5 boys under one roof with Hae Kang's parents and little sister. Together they persue the sports they love so much, explore life &amp; relationships, help each other to improve as players and seek happiness in staying together. The story at some points also throws light upon the past of some characters. <br><br>Again, the story involves few villagers who are the neighbours of these badminton fellows staying under the orange roof. All these people help each other during odds as well as celebrate their evens together, which actually portrays the life of a typical village or country side region, irrespective of counties. This was a very good side of the drama to witness and a perfect concept of slice of life stories, I feel. <br><br>The story additionally involves badminton players from different schools, regions and countries, plenty of coaches &amp; association members, shop, store, restro, motel owners, saffs, etc etc.<br><br>Since it's a coming of age story, you'll literally go through an emotional rollercoaster which involves both happy &amp; sad moments that will make you cry outta despair or sometimes the tears of joy. One moment you'll be smiling wide and the next moment you'll be laughing the hell out of you and other times you'll be crying out of nostalgia.<br><br>CAST &amp; ACTING: <br>I feel Racket Boys could have got much more recognition than this in its real time airing if most of the Kdrama audience were not always focused on the starcast of a drama. I know a lot of people are watching it but still it deserves more. The story is of teenagers and the production did a very good job in casting them. Unlike many highscool Kdrama where actors in their middle or late 20s are casted for 18-20 yo characters, Racket Boys casted actual teenagers, hence bringing change in the norms. Also, the writer of this drama was also the writer of Prison Playbook, so you'll see many characters from that drama here and also many guest appearances.<br><br>There is definite character development for each and every single character in this drama, irrespective of their roles, from oldies to youngs. Let me describe the main characters, which is a bit lengthy because I don't really write a lot about this part but the growth of characters in this drama is actually something to be noted and learnt.<br><br>The main lead Yoon Hae Kang (Tang Joon Sang) is actually a very good Korean-Malyasian teen actor who rose to fame even though he has few dramas, after his role in CLOY. Loved him playing an asperger kid in "Move to Heaven" and "Racket Boys" hopefully brings him the recognition he deserves for his skills. His character always aspired to win and was pretty conceited, also a lil narcissist. His expressions and way of delivery were so on point and he needs to be praised for that.<br><br>Kim Kang Hoon, almost everyone's favourite child actor has always mesmerized us with his acting and in this drama he got a cute character who is always emotional, yet clueless. His countryside accent is so cute and I totally loved him as Lee Young Tae.<br><br>Bang Yoon Dam (Song Sang Yeon) is so handsome *blushes under the blanket*. I thought he'll have a somewhat cool character but he's someone who is selfie &amp; sns addict who ends up taking selfies with everyone he meets. He is very easy-peasy.<br><br>Choi Hyun Wook is cute and his character Na Woo Chan with a father who is a military personnel had to struggle a lot about choosing a path that made him happy yet question on his capabilities. The way he kept going and got motivated every time from others, is really well shown.<br><br>Lee Jae In as Han Se Yeon is the most talented badminton player in the world who rarely loses a match, is always calm and relax while playing a match. She loves her team and her coach but isn't open to everyone. She knows how to work under pressure at any given condition.<br><br>Lee Ji Won (Lee Han Sol) and Kim Min Ki (Jung In Sol) did very good job. Han Sol is a straightforward girl and Se Yeon's best friend who gives her best and improves with time. In Sol, the so called Nerd who ranks 1st in the province and the son of a councilman joins the team for his love for badminton and his craving to make friends and hangout with them. The child actor who played Yoon Hae In (Hae Kang's little sister) was cute and her character is mature for her age, which she actually played well.<br><br>Kim Sang Kyung as coach Yoon Hyun Jung played a good character who is aware of his own weaknesses and incompetency and always tried his best to improve himself just so he can help his students better. He was super funny, supportive, loving coach, father, husband and colleague that everyone loved him. Oh Na Ra as coach Ra Young Ja was fierce who never compromised with her teaching methods and her students' well being. She always fought for a fairer environment for the players. Head Coach Bae/White Wolf was such an inspiring character who despite of his strict &amp; disciplined nature strived to provide everything to everyone whom he's responsible for. I loved him.<br><br>If I go further I might end up talking about all of them because there were a LOT of familiar and old (as in by age) faces in this drama whom I have loved, respected and cherished for a long a time. I was so happy to see all of them in this single drama. Also so many guest appearances from the Prison Playbook cast plus others; such a delightful journey it was to witness.<br><br>DIRECTION &amp; WRITING:<br>This drama given its genre, setup and vibes has been able to achieve a great direction from Jo Young Kwang pd-nim who has a good history of directing beautiful dramas before. The editing is just like as it should have been for a slice of life drama. Synchronisation, organization, connection, intertwining, linking and presentation, everything is good. Even sound editing in different situations, i.e. funny, emotional, inspirational, romantic, energetic, etc, has been perfectly done; just like it should have been for a light heart comedy and feel good drama. The cinematography is top notch. In sports shows, it's necessary to take care about the angles of videography and showcase the movements &amp; techniques of the players perfectly and this drama has been able to do it very well.<br><br>Jung Bo Hoon jakkanim is a disciple of the legendary writer Lee Woo Jung jakkanim who has created masterpiece dramas all her life and have worked together in "Prison Playbook". Undoubtedly, Bo Hoon jakkanim just like "Prison Playbook" has again delivered a masterpiece drama "Racket Boys". The screenwriting, dialogues, line coordination, scene organization and everything has been very well done by him and hence he needs appreciation. Also, he needs to work and create more and I'm sure he'll do better.<br><br>When I said that this drama reminded me of the REPLY SERIES, especially "Reply 1988" , I honesty meant it. <br><br>OSTs:<br>I suppose there are 5 OSTs in total along with the number of featured old &amp; modern songs that the characters in the drama listen. Just like the title, the drama has some references of Bangtan Sonyeondan (BTS) and there songs, hence following the trend. Tbh, the OSTs are not that extraordinary here but I feel they're appropriately fit for the kind of vibes this drama gives off. In fact, it's okay for a slice of life drama to have less OSTs because the number of scenes are really high and they won't want to use OSTs a lot in the story, otherwise it'd be lengthy. So, they put them as background scores during conversations.<br><br>I love "Will Be" by The Boyz the most which is clearly the main theme OST for the drama used as a mean of power source, inspiration, motivation and pushes you forward. "Focus on Me" by Coffeeboy is a light romantic track mostly used for the subtle romance between the teen lead couple. "I Love You Teacher" , "Cloud" and "To Find Myself" are good too. <br><br>DESCRIPTION:<br>I think I have described how I feel about this drama enough but I feel I have either run out of words or got lot more to say. This drama truly belongs to that category of Korean shows which you should watch whenever you feel down or in a mood of watching a beautiful and feel good thing. <br><br>The screenplay is in a mixed manner where one particular scene doesn't run constantly and rather another event that's going on simultaneously is showed in between; that's the technique for a slice of life drama. Majority of the things which seemed to be something turned out be another. Comedy scenes are accompanied by emotional turnovers in the end or vice versa. There were things that taught us stuffs about life, sports, teaching, parenting, social life, etc. <br><br>Since the drama focuses on badminton it honestly reminded me of the old days when I played the sports. In fact, it is the only outdoor sports I can play well though I don't get to play often these days. It revived the love I have had for this game. It also throws light on the reputation of badminton among the major sports, people's thoughts about it and the youths'  interest in it. The life of badminton athletes, their struggle to keep going among lots of other competitors or peers, the perspective of the coaches, the happenings inside the association and the environment of badminton courts as well as school/province/national level competitions, etc have been very well portrayed in the drama. The way they have shown all the competitions, the games in it and the sets played by the athelets, is very good, though not entirely shown. I think that's fine since it's a drama and they had a lot to show, even things other than the sports. An athlete's way of handling pressure, tackling the opponent, coping to the changing environment, even sometimes giving in as well as giving up, all these also included which are essential parts of their life and the sports.<br><br>I love how the village/country-side things like the lifestyle, the environment, the socio-cultural behaviour, the developing relationships, the agri-farm businesses, etc have been picturized in this drama. They sometimes hesitated to make acquaintances and were holding each other tight the next moment. They fought with each other several times and ended up crying tears of joy/pain together some other time. The love and support of the villagers for the Racket Boys was enormous. The old lady's affection for kids was so overwhelming to see; she enjoyed having more kids under her roof, always fed them with their favorite delicacies and even protected them some times. The progressing life of Seoul couple who moved to the village because of situations, has also been beautifully written. The way they grew fond of the village and it's people was even more heart-touching. <br><br>The things between the association like the bonding between the coaches, the coaches' urge to do better for their students, the management as well as selection procedures in the sport plus the corrupt and unfair doings of handful number of bad people has been shown. The way everything was handled, corrected and planned was very good.<br><br>Lastly, the portrayal of different relationship between the cast, such as, parents-children, elderly &amp; middle-aged couples/partner/spouses, brother-sister, coach-athelete, teacher-student, friends, opponents, etc. made this drama very beautiful, I truly love the way they've been shown. The subtle romance between Yoon Hae Kang and Se Yeon was very cute. They would have shown more of it if they were a lil older but I feel it's totally okay since the drama doesn't focuses or in fact requires romance. The 2nd couple in the drama were cute as well (not spoiling).  <br><br>About the controversy, it's again incorrectly misinterpreted. How is it racist to tell that the audience discourage the opponent athlete and the country provides unsuitable environment to the guest athletes? I understand it sometimes feels offensive but that's how sports and army dramas/movies work. Every country does that while producing things about their own athlete. I too was angry at such gestures of my own country doing the same in every sports movie until I came to realize this is one of the dramatic elements in a movie/series meant for entertainment and it's not throwing mud to the other country. They don't complain or criticise because they also think the same and are sane enough to differentiate what's racism . Firstly, this isn't what you call racism and finally, this isn't demeaning at all to the mentioned country. I am sure no one would have cared if they had mentioned a country from the West or even another country from the East.<br><br>The ending was good. The last 2 episodes were all about the main national level competition that the boys and even the girls had been waiting for. The games have lengthier duration and before or between the each game, they have shown, how the athletes were motivated, guided or instructed by many people. I loved the ending. Won't say more or it'd serve as spoiler.<br><br>CONCLUSION:<br>The drama was an absolute treat to my eyes, to my heart and to my mental health that gave me the wholesome nostalgic feelings throughout and made me want more of it. I am sad that it has ended. I started it 3 weeks back, 2 days before it was supposed to end but I was honestly very sad and angry when they kept delaying for 2 consecutive weeks. It felt like ages waiting for the finale and it has actually delivered all my expectations and anticipations that I have had for the last 2 weeks; I am glad for that. <br><br>Honestly, at some points of the drama the screenplay felt a lil slow and some other points the plot felt moderately blunt but thankfully it caught it's original momentum back in the next instance, every time. There are definitely few flaws in other technical aspects as well but anyways RACKET BOYS, overally, is a very good drama which is binge worthy and will make your day better any time you wanna watch it. The rewatch value is very high, i.e. you can watch it again and again, that too it can be placed under random play dramas that you can start from any point and can easily get into. Go ahead and watch it ASAP.<br><br>DEFINITELY COMING BACK TO THIS.  <p class="read-more"><a href="#" class="button">Read More</a></p>  <div class="review-helpful m-t p-t xb-t"> <div class="review-vote review-helpful-157203"><span class="text-muted">Was this review helpful to you?</span> <button class="btn btn-xs white helpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="157203" data-label="Yes"><span>Yes</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white unhelpful review-cast-helpful" data-id="157203" data-label="No"><span>No</span></button> <button class="btn btn-xs white review-cancel-vote" data-id="157203"><span>Cancel</span></button>  <button class="btn btn-xs btn-gift-award" data-id="157203"></button>  </div> </div> </div> </div> </div>
