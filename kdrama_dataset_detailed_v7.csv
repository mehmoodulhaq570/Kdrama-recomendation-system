As time passes, her mother Lee Kang-ae (Kim Hee-ae) becomes one of the country's bestselling authors. Consequently, she never found time to spend with her daughter. One day, Da-mi accidentally intercepts a phone call from her father, Yoo Geon-hee (Lee Jae-ryong), and realizes that her mother has lied to her all these years about her father's whereabouts. Angry, Da-mi rebels by deciding not to go to college, despite having excellent grades in high school. On a whim, she accompanies her friend to an audition, and becomes an actress instead. Coincidentally, the first film Da-mi stars in is based on one of Kang-ae's novels. During one of their heated arguments, Da-mi tells her mother that she's going to Japan to search for her father. Meanwhile, at her side is her boss's stepbrother, Ha Young-chan (Kim Kibum), a family friend who secretly loves Da-mi and keeps helping her even though she's rejected his feelings."
